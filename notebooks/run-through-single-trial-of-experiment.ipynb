The primary goal of life insurance is to provide financial security for the policyholder's loved ones, assisting them in managing economic obligations like debts, living expenses, and costs related to medical care or funerals [5]. There are two main types of life insurance: Term Life Insurance, which provides coverage for a predetermined duration, and Permanent Life Insurance, which offers lifelong coverage and may include a cash value component [5].\n",
