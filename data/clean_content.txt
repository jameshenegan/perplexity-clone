# Why do I need Life Insurance? 

## Answer 1

Life insurance is necessary to help your loved ones with financial needs if you aren’t there anymore. It considers factors such as your age, financial situation, and if you have people who depend on your income. Important considerations include covering debts like a mortgage, replacing your income, covering funeral costs, and funding college for children. 

Term life insurance is suitable for those with dependents or a mortgage and is generally the least expensive option. It provides coverage for a specified period. Permanent life insurance offers coverage for your entire life but is more costly and complex. 

Having life insurance is a way to ensure that your beneficiaries—such as a spouse, children, or other family members—are financially supported after your death.

## Answer 2

Life insurance is important because it protects your spouse and children from potentially devastating financial losses if something happens to you. It provides financial security, helps pay off debts, living expenses, and any medical or final expenses. The policy delivers a specified sum of money upon your death, which is generally not subject to federal income taxes, ensuring that your beneficiaries receive full benefits.

Here are some key reasons to get life insurance:

1. **Guaranteed protection**: Life insurance benefit acts as a financial safety net for your dependents.
2. **Income replacement**: It ensures your family has the necessary funds to maintain their living standards if your income disappears.
3. **Tax-free benefit**: Beneficiaries receive the death benefit tax-free.
4. **Guaranteed cash value growth**: Whole life policies build cash value that can meet various financial goals.
5. **Dividend potential**: Policyholders may receive dividends, which can be used in different ways, including offsetting premiums or increasing coverage.
6. **Optional riders**: You can customize your policy with additional protections tailored to your needs.

Overall, life insurance can provide peace of mind by ensuring a financial legacy for your loved ones.
