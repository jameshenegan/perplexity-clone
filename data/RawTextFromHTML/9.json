Each type of life insurance is designed to fill a specific coverage need. For example, term life insurance is geared toward those who just need coverage for a certain number of years, while whole life insurance is designed for those who need straightforward, lifelong coverage. 5 min to readExplore Progressive's editorial standards for Answers articles to find out why you can trust the insurance information you find here.Key takeawaysThere are five main types of life insurance that cater to specific coverage needsThere are alternative types of life insurance that don't require a medical examAnswersLife insurance informationTypes of life insurance explainedGet quoteWhat are the different types of life insurance?\nThe different types of life insurance vary based on their coverage length, complexity, coverage amount, cash value, and other features. \nJump to a section using the links below to learn more about:\n\nTerm life insurance\nWhole life insurance\nUniversal life insurance\nVariable life insurance\nFinal expense life insurance\nOther types of life insurance\n\nCompare the different types of life insurance\nUse this chart to quickly compare the five key types of life insurance policies:Life insurance typeCoverage lengthBest for agesBuilds cash value?Medical exam required?Death benefit amountTermCoverage length10, 15, 20, 30 yearsBest for ages18 \u2013 65Builds cash value?NoMedical exam required?VariesDeath benefit amount$100,000+WholeCoverage lengthYour lifetimeBest for ages18 \u2013 65Builds cash value?YesMedical exam required?Yes*Death benefit amount$50,000+UniversalCoverage lengthYour lifetimeBest for ages18 \u2013 65Builds cash value?YesMedical exam required?YesDeath benefit amount$50,000+Variable\u2020Coverage lengthYour lifetimeBest for ages18 \u2013 65Builds cash value?YesMedical exam required?YesDeath benefit amount$50,000+Final ExpenseCoverage lengthYour lifetimeBest for ages50 \u2013 85Builds cash value?YesMedical exam required?NoDeath benefit amount$2,500 \u2013 $40,000Term life insurance\nTerm life insurance is generally more affordable than permanent life insurance. It provides coverage for a set number of years, paying out as long as your policy hasn't expired and you've paid the premiums. You can lock in your rate for the entire term period, which makes budgeting and planning easier.\nAt the end of the term period, and based on the product options available, you may be able to renew your policy at an adjusted rate. However, you can typically only renew a term life policy on a year-to-year basis \u2014 not for another term period. Your new rate will be based on your age and health at the time of renewal, and you may or may not need a medical exam to obtain coverage. You may also be able to convert your term life policy to whole life at the end of your term.\nWhole life insurance\nWhole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that provides coverage for your entire lifetime, paying your benefit no matter when you pass away \u2014 as long as you keep paying your bill. Whole life insurance also includes a savings component that a portion of your premium will pay into. The savings component has a fixed interest rate that builds cash value over time, which is part of the reason whole life policies typically cost more than term life policies with similar coverage.\nThe cash value of your policy won't affect the death benefit paid out upon your passing. However, if it grows to equal your death benefit amount by the time you're a set age (usually 100 or 120), your insurer will terminate your policy and pay out the coverage amount.\nIf you're not banking on living to 100, you can withdraw some cash value funds as a life insurance loan. There's typically no credit check required and a minimal loan approval process. You repay the loan with interest, or if you pass away before returning the funds, the remaining loan amount and interest will be withdrawn from the payout to your beneficiaries.\nUniversal life insurance\nUniversal life insurance is another permanent life insurance option, providing coverage for your entire life as long as you pay the premiums. It's sometimes called adjustable life insurance because it offers more flexibility than a whole life policy. For example, universal life policies allow you to increase or decrease your death benefit and even adjust or skip your monthly premium (within certain limits).\nAs with whole life, a universal life policy has a savings component that grows and allows for borrowing. However, a universal life policy works differently than a whole life policy in two key ways:The interest rate for a universal life policy's cash value is not fixed. You'll have a guaranteed minimum interest rate, but in general, the rate at which your cash value builds can change over time based on market conditions.Your universal life policy's cash value can eventually grow and result in a zero-cost policy, in which all premiums are paid from the built-up value.Variable life insurance\u2020 \nVariable life insurance is a riskier type of permanent life insurance. A common variable life insurance policy design is built on two pieces:\nA face value death benefit: Just as with whole life and universal life, when you purchase a variable life policy, you'll select a fixed death benefit to be paid out upon your passing as long as you pay your premiums.\nA variable cash value: Your cash value will rise and fall based on your payments and the performance of your selected investments. Unlike with whole life, your variable life cash value can be part of your death benefit.\nThe greater range of investment options offered by a variable life policy means it could, in the long run, provide a greater benefit to your beneficiaries when you pass away \u2014 especially if you're a savvy investor. But it also opens you up to much higher risk, fees, and costs than whole life or universal life policies.\nFinal expense life insurance\nAlso known as funeral or burial insurance, final expense insurance is a type of whole life insurance that offers a smaller and more affordable death benefit designed to help cover your end-of-life expenses like funeral costs, medical bills, or outstanding debt. While other types of life insurance may have age and health requirements, final expense policies can be easier for older or less-healthy individuals to qualify for. A final expense policy's cash value operates the same as a whole life policy's, building value at a fixed rate over time.Pro tip:There are also different types of life insurance riders you can add to a policy to change how your life insurance works under certain circumstances.Other types of life insurance\nIndexed universal life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance with a cash value that grows based on a stock market index such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ. You can adjust your premium as the cash value of the policy increases, which can result in a policy whose cash value pays the premiums.Simplified issue life insurance is a type of life insurance that doesn\u2019t require a medical exam. This can be beneficial for healthy individuals who need a policy quickly because the approval process can be much faster. Depending on the insurer and policy, coverage could begin within minutes to a few days compared to a standard life insurance policy that could take a month or longer. This type of life insurance generally costs more and could have a smaller coverage amount due to the increased risk the insurer takes on by simplifying the application process.Instant life insurance is a specific type of simplified issue policy that you can apply for online and often get a decision within minutes. Instant life insurance is similar to simplified issue but may have higher and more affordable coverage options.Guaranteed life insurance is a type of policy that does not ask medical questions and your application cannot be turned down.\nOther kinds of non-traditional life insurance include:\nSupplemental life insurance can provide additional coverage beyond what your company's group life policy offers. You can purchase it from your employer (if offered) or a private insurance company for an additional premium.Survivorship life insurance covers two people on a single policy that pays a death benefit once both policyholders have passed away. A type of joint life insurance, survivorship policies can be part of an estate plan and a way to leave an inheritance for heirs.Decreasing term life insurance provides coverage with a death benefit that gets smaller over time, making the policy more affordable than a standard term policy because the payout diminishes.AD&D insurance is a category of life insurance that will only pay out if the insured person is in an accident that causes death or serious injuries such as the loss of limbs, sight, or paralysis.\nWhat type of life insurance is best for me?\nWhen choosing the type of life insurance that's best for you, consider where you are right now in life by asking yourself these questions:What is your age?Do you have people who depend on your income who would suffer if you were no longer around?What are your investment goals and estate planning goals, or do you just want coverage to pay for your final expenses?Consider how much coverage you'll need using Progressive's life insurance calculator, and what you can afford to pay each month.Get a free life insurance quote online in minutesGet a quoteOr, call 1-866-912-2477Learn more about life insurance policies.Related articlesTerm vs. whole life insurance 4 min to readWhat is the difference between whole life vs. universal life insurance? 3 min to readHow does life insurance work? 5 min to readRelated categoriesInsurance basicsTerms & definitionsHave more questions?

Term life insurance is a simple, low-cost policy, and its main purpose is to replace your income when you die.How it works: Term life insurance is typically sold in lengths of one, five, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years. Coverage amounts vary depending on the policy but can go into the millions. Most people buy term life insurance for a length long enough to cover their prime working years. That way, if they die early, they can help a surviving spouse or other beneficiary meet short-term financial needs like paying off a mortgage or supporting their kids through college.Pros: It\u2019s often the cheapest life insurance, and it's sufficient for most people.Cons: If you outlive your policy, your beneficiaries won\u2019t receive a payout.Learn about the best term life insurance companiesThese carriers topped our list of the best term life insurance companies in 2024.InsurerNerdWallet ratingGuardian5.0NerdWallet rating\u00a0NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

But generally, this type of coverage allows you to adjust your premiums (within limits) and has a cash value component that grows based on market interest rates. Premiums typically increase over time, forcing you to increase your premium payments or cover rising costs by subtracting from your cash value account or death benefit. Universal life insurance is different from indexed universal life insurance \u2014 with those policies, the cash value growth is tied to a stock or bond index like the S&P 500.Pros: It\u2019s typically less expensive than whole life insurance and can adapt to your needs as life changes.Cons: The death benefit and cash value growth are not guaranteed.\u00bb MORE: What is universal life insurance? Pros, cons and cost\u2191 Back to topVariable life insuranceBest for: Those with a higher risk tolerance who want greater control over their cash value investments.How it works: This type of cash value life insurance is tied to investment accounts, such as bonds and mutual funds. Variable life insurance premiums are typically fixed and the death benefit is guaranteed, regardless of how the market fares. If you\u2019re considering a policy like this, a fee-only financial advisor \u2014 a planner who doesn\u2019t earn commissions based on product sales \u2014 can help you choose the best one.Pros: There is potential for considerable gains if your investment choices do well.Cons: It requires you to be hands-on in managing your policy because the cash value can change daily based on the market.\ud83e\udd13Nerdy TipSome insurers offer a hybrid policy known as variable universal life insurance. This has similar features to variable life insurance, except the premiums are adjustable \u2014 which may suit those who don\u2019t want to commit to paying the same amount in premiums each month.\u00bb MORE: A guide to variable life and variable universal life insurance\u2191 Back to topBurial insurance or final expense insuranceBest for: People who want to cover their own funeral, burial and other end-of-life expenses.How it works: Also known as final expense insurance, burial insurance is a small whole life insurance policy that is meant to help your family pay for your funeral, burial and other expenses after your death, like outstanding medical bills. The death benefit is guaranteed and typically ranges from $5,000 to $25,000.Pros: A medical exam isn\u2019t typically required, making it more accessible to seniors with pre-existing health conditions.Cons: Coverage is capped at low amounts. If you die within two or three years of taking out your policy, your insurer may not pay the full death benefit.Learn about the best burial insurance companiesThese insurers made our list of the best burial insurance companies in 2024.InsurerNerdWallet ratingAge eligibilityState Farm5.0NerdWallet rating\u00a0NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Premiums are based on the group as a whole rather than each individual. In general, employers offer basic coverage for free, with the option to purchase supplemental life insurance if you need more coverage.Mortgage life insurance covers the current balance of your mortgage and pays out to the lender, not your family, if you die.Credit life insurance pays the balance of a specific loan, like a home equity loan. Your bank might offer to sell you a credit life insurance policy when you take out a loan. If you die, the policy pays off the lender, not your family.Accidental death and dismemberment insurance covers you if you die in an accident, such as a car crash. AD&D insurance also pays out for the loss of limbs as well as the loss of your sight or hearing \u2014 but it\u2019s typically offered only through the workplace.Joint life insurance insures two lives, usually those of spouses, under one policy:First-to-die: Pays out after the first policyholder dies. The policy would then expire; it doesn\u2019t continue to cover the second person. These policies are extremely rare because the demand for them is low.Second-to-die: Pays out after both policyholders die. These policies can be used to cover estate taxes or the care of a dependent after both policyholders die.\u00bb MORE: Compare life insurance quotes\u2191 Back to topFind the right life insurance plan for youMake sure you and your loved ones are covered - compare customized life insurance quotes from our partners.Compare with PolicygeniusDifferent types of life insurance by underwritingUnderwriting refers to how a life insurance company calculates the risks of insuring you. A policy\u2019s underwriting determines a few things, like how quickly your coverage will go in force, whether you\u2019ll need to take a medical exam and the price you\u2019ll pay.There are three main types of life insurance underwriting:Fully underwritten life insuranceIf you're healthy, fully underwritten policies will generally be the cheapest option.This is because the life insurance application process typically includes a medical exam and questions about your health as well as questions about your family\u2019s health history, your hobbies and your travel plans.Insurers use this data to price the policy more accurately based on your specific life expectancy. To get the most favorable rate, aim to provide as much information as possible when filling out your application.Simplified issue life insuranceSimplified issue policies don\u2019t require you to take a medical exam. However, you may be asked a few health questions and could be turned down based on your answers.Instant-approval life insurance policies use quick, online health questionnaires as well as algorithms and big data to speed up the application process.Guaranteed issue life insuranceGuaranteed issue life insurance requires no medical exams and no health questions. In short, you can\u2019t be turned down for coverage if you\u2019re within the eligible age range, which is typically 40 to 85. However, this is an expensive way to buy life insurance, and coverage amounts are generally low.In addition, these policies have graded death benefits, which means if you die within the first few years of having the policy, your beneficiaries may receive only a partial payout. People often buy this type of life insurance if they\u2019ve been turned down elsewhere because of their health but they want to cover final expenses, such as funeral costs.Which type of life insurance should you get?Still not sure which type of life insurance is right for you?

first consider your needs and understand the different type of insurance products that are available.\u00a0 Many more consumers are using life and annuity products as part of their financial planning goals.\u00a0 Consumers spend substantial sums of money each year on life insurance policies or annuity contracts knowing very little about what it is that they are getting.\u00a0 This guide was developed to help consumers make educated decisions and to help them understand both the benefits and the risks involved in financial planning.\nThe purpose of this information guide is to help you understand what type of life insurance policies or annuity contracts are available.\u00a0 If one type of policy or contract does not fit your needs, then ask and find out about other available policies or contracts, many of which are described in this information guide.\u00a0 You can research more information on life insurance policies or annuity contracts by checking with a licensed life insurance agent or a licensed life insurance company.\u00a0 You can also visit your public library for\u00a0 material or books on financial planning.\u00a0 Life insurance or annuity information is also available on the Internet.\u00a0 In addition, The California Department of Insurance (CDI) has a toll-free Hotline telephone number and website that can provide further information and assistance on life insurance policies and annuity contracts.\u00a0 Please see the many ways to contact the CDI on the last page of this information guide.\u00a0 This information guide is divided into two sections:\u00a0 Life Insurance and Annuities.\u00a0 \nBack to Top\nDefining Your Needs\nThe purchase of life insurance is an important decision for both you and your family.\u00a0 There are many reasons why life insurance policies or annuity contracts are purchased, but these reasons should be based upon your financial planning needs.\u00a0 Factors such as your marital status, number of dependents and cost for their support, future education needs, current and anticipated family income, and your current assets and debt obligations all play a role in determining the amount of life insurance that is right for you. \nLife Insurance\nChoosing the Amount of Life Insurance\nYour need for life insurance will vary with your age and responsibilities. The amount of insurance you buy should depend on the standard of living you wish to assure for your dependents. You should consider the amount of assets and sources of continuing income available to your dependents when you pass away. Simply stated, you should choose an amount of life insurance that is determined necessary to meet the needs you are trying to satisfy.\u00a0 A balance needs to be achieved in this process.\u00a0 To be over-insured can negatively affect your budget and threaten your long range financial goals just as much as being under-insured can. While each person must individually assess their responsibilities, needs, and financial situation, it is important to be careful to choose an amount of life insurance that reflects your specific circumstances without under-insuring or over-insuring.\nSteps To Determine How Much Life Insurance You Need:\n\n\u00a0Determine how much life insurance you need based on the factors mentioned above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Decide how much money you can afford to pay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choose the type of life insurance policy that meets your coverage goals and current family budget. Fitting these two factors together will move\u00a0 you\u00a0toward a successful overall financial plan.\n\n\u00a0Once you have completed these steps, you will be able to move ahead and contact several life insurance companies (through an agent or broker) to shop for the right type of policy for you. \u00a0There are many reasons for purchasing life insurance, among which are the following:\n\nInsurance to provide financial protection and security for surviving family members upon the death of the insured person. Insurance to cover a particular need such as paying off a mortgage or other debt upon the insured's death. Business insurance to compensate a company on the death of a key employee or to provide a surviving partner the resources to buy out the deceased partner's share of the business. Insurance to provide funds to pay estate taxes or other final obligations necessary to settle a deceased person's estate. Insurance to provide the funds necessary for the deceased person's burial expenses.\n\nBack to Top\nChoosing the Appropriate Type of Life Insurance\n\u00a0There are two basic types of life insurance: Term Life Insurance and Cash Value Life Insurance.\u00a0 There are many policy variations between these two types of life insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Term Policies provide life insurance for a specified period of time.\u00a0 This period could be as short as one year or provide coverage for a specific number of years such as 5, 10, 20 years or to a specified age.\u00a0 If you die during the term period, the company will pay the face value to your beneficiary.\u00a0 If you live beyond the term period you had selected, no benefit is payable. As a rule, term policies offer a death benefit with no savings element or cash value.\u00a0 If you have a limited amount to spend, and only need insurance for a specified period of time, you may be able to get more coverage by buying term insurance than by buying cash value insurance. Keep in mind that the cost of term insurance increases as you get older, which may make it more expensive than cash value insurance in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0 Today\u2019s term policies usually have two sets of premiums: guaranteed maximum premiums and current premiums.\u00a0 Current premiums are usually much lower, but they can be changed by the insurance company.\u00a0 The insurance company cannot increase the current premium above the guaranteed maximum premiums shown in the policy.When you buy term insurance, you need to make a choice as to how long you want the protection.\u00a0 You may renew the policy without a physical examination for the period of years specified in the policy.\u00a0 Some term insurance can be converted to cash value insurance up to a specified age with no physical examination.\u00a0 Premiums for the converted insurance will most likely be higher than the premiums you would be paying for the term insurance.\u00a0 If you do not pay the premium for your term insurance, it will generally lapse without cash value, as compared to a permanent type of policy that has a cash value component.\u00a0\nCash Value Insurance combines death benefits with a cash value accumulation feature. The buyer of a cash value policy pays more in the early years than for term insurance, but the premium not needed to pay for the cost of the death benefit accumulates with interest within the policy. If the policy is surrendered before the insured person dies, there may be a cash value paid to the owner, less any outstanding loans placed against the policy.\nMake sure the agent/broker provides you with the method by which the cash value is determined and that they obtain this information based on the policy's guaranteed value. It is not a good idea to buy a cash value life insurance policy if you plan to surrender early due to substantial surrender penalties. If all premiums are paid, cash value insurance usually lasts for the entire life of a person and pays death benefits to the beneficiaries named in the policy upon the death of the insured. The cash value can be used as loan collateral for borrowing funds at the interest rate specified in the policy. Any outstanding loans are deducted from policy proceeds at death or at policy surrender.\nSome of these products may enjoy tax advantages while they remain active. Therefore, a policy lapse or surrender may create a taxable event and may generate a Form 1099. Form 1099s are sent to the IRS for tax purposes; be sure to check with your tax advisor. Some of the most popular types of cash value insurance are described below:\nBack to Top\n\nWhole Life Insurance\u00a0(also known as straight life, ordinary life, and traditional permanent insurance) is designed to provide coverage for your entire lifetime unlike term insurance which provides protection for a specified time period.\u00a0 To keep the premium level, the premium at the younger ages exceed the actual cost of protection.\u00a0 This extra premium builds a reserve (cash value) which helps pay for the policy in later years as the cost of protection rises above the premium.\u00a0 Whole life policies stretch the cost of insurance over a longer period of time in order to level out the otherwise increasing cost of insurance.\u00a0 Under some policies, premiums are required to be paid for a set number of years.\u00a0 Under other policies, premiums are paid throughout the policyholder's lifetime. \nUniversal Life Insurance\u00a0\u00a0is the most flexible of all the various kinds of policies because it treats the elements of the policy separately; universal life allows you to change or skip premium payments or change the death benefit more easily than any other policy.\u00a0 It works by treating the three elements of the policy \u2014 premium, death benefit, and cash value \u2014 separately. Cash values are accumulated by crediting premium payments and interest to a fund from which deductions are made for expenses and cost of insurance.\u00a0 Interest rates are linked to an external index such as Treasury bills.\u00a0 Because the cash value element of this type of policy is interest-rate sensitive, predictions of future costs are highly dependent upon the accuracy of interest rate projections.\u00a0 The policy can also be structured to operate like term insurance.\nVariable Life Insurance has a death benefit that varies in relation to the investment experience of the assets underlying the policy.\u00a0 A higher rate of return on the invested fund will cause the death benefits to increase, while a low or negative rate will cause the death benefits to decrease.\nVariable Universal Life Insurance Insurance combines the flexibility of universal life insurance with the investment account features of variable life insurance. \u00a0Back to Top\nVarious type of Life Insurance policies\n\n\n\nType of Policy\nPremium\nFace Amount\nCash Value\nPolicy Loans\n\n\nTerm\nLow; but increase w/age\nRenewable into old age\nNone\nNo\n\n\nWhole\nLevel\nLevel; can't be changed\nYes; no ability to choose investments\nYes\n\n\nUniveral\nFlexible\nLevel; can vary\nYes; no ability to choose investment\nYes\n\n\nVariable\nLevel\nLevel; Can't be changed\nYes; abililty to choose investments\nYes\n\n\nVariable Universal\nFlexible\nLevel; can vary\nYes; ability to choose investments\nYes\n\n\n\nGroup Insurance\nMany employers offer life insurance under a group plan and sometimes pay part or all of the premium.\u00a0 A medical exam is usually not required for insurance purchased this way, and the insurance can be less expensive than coverage purchased as an individual.\u00a0 Under California law, group life insurance must be convertible to permanent insurance at the insured's option when the insured's coverage under the group policy terminates.\u00a0 The converted policy will probably be much more expensive than the group insurance.\u00a0 Some employers will allow insurance companies to send agents or enrollers to their premises in order to offer insurance to their employees.\u00a0 Policies offered in this manner are different from group insurance, and you should evaluate the materials shown to you in the same way as if you were considering a purchase of an individual policy through an agent.\nInsurance by Mail Order or Through the Internet\nSome insurance companies solicit by mail or through the Internet. In most cases, the prospective buyer mails a completed application directly to the company. Both Internet and mail order marketing may not provide a complete range of choices as target marketing often involves offering only one type of policy.

You should verify that the insurance company offering the coverage is licensed to sell life insurance in California.\nSales Illustrations\nIt is likely that an agent will show you one or more life insurance sales illustrations.\u00a0 An illustration consists of a series of numbers indicating how the policy works.\u00a0 The illustration usually shows the guaranteed results under the policy for each year in the future, and the results if all the non-guaranteed items continue at their present level.\u00a0 Actual results may be better or worse than the non-guaranteed amounts shown in the illustration (but not worse than those that are guaranteed).Using Indexes\nYour chances of finding a good buy on a life insurance policy is better if you use the index numbers that have been developed to aid you in shopping for life insurance.\u00a0 The Buyer\u2019s Guide that each insurer is required to provide to a purchaser explains these index numbers in detail.\u00a0 They are good tools to help you compare the merits of similar policies.\u00a0\nBack to Top\nImportant Facts If You Are Considering Changes to Your Life Insurance Policy\nMany consumers are approached by life insurance agents or life sales representatives and are asked to consider canceling their current life insurance policy in order to purchase a replacement policy.\u00a0 In most cases, the cash value of the current life policy is used to buy more insurance or a new policy.\u00a0 While a decision to replace an existing life insurance policy may be a good one, sometimes this may not be in your best interest.\u00a0 More than likely you purchased your policy with a long term financial plan in mind.\u00a0 Replacing or changing your insurance policy at this point may affect the intended results of your overall financial plan.\u00a0 If you are considering replacing or changing your life insurance policy, you should first assess your needs and determine what is in your own long term best interest.\u00a0 It is also important to consider the interests of those you are protecting.\u00a0 Deciding how much insurance you need, how long it is needed, and which policy provides the best coverage is crucial to your financial security.Your financial needs should be thoroughly evaluated before changes are made in existing policies.\u00a0 Any change in your personal circumstances since you first purchased life insurance may require a different strategy.\u00a0 A comprehensive evaluation may indicate that replacing or changing your policy is advisable.\u00a0 However, certain cautions are appropriate when considering replacing or changing your life insurance.\u00a0 For example:\n\nYou may have to pay \u201cstart up\u201d costs again.You may be required to wait one or two years before a new policy passes through the contestable period.\u00a0 During the contestable period the insurer\u00a0 is contractually entitled to cancel the policy or refuse to pay a claim based on omissions, or mistaken or untrue statements in your application.\u00a0You may pay a higher premium for new insurance over the duration of the policy because you are older than when you first purchased life insurance.The financial strength of a new insurer may be different from that of your present insurer.\u00a0\u00a0There may be specific tax consequences when you replace or change your current policy.You may find different loan provisions in a new policy, or you may find that you cannot take tax advantaged loans in the new policy.If you use the cash value of one policy to pay for the premium on a new policy, the values used may not be sufficient to support the new policy in future years, and may result in the need to make additional premium payments to keep the insurance in force.You may not have immediate access to your money in a new policy.\u00a0 You may have to wait a considerable period of time, or pay a monetary penalty, to access the cash value in the policy.Tax consequences may occur if you take cash from an annuity or mutual fund that started as a replacement policy for your original life insurance policy.\u00a0When considering policy replacement, it is important to note that you may have the ability to amend or convert your current policy to a newer\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 product within the same insurance company without any loss of rights or accumulated cash value.\u00a0 It may be in your best interest to contact your current agent or company and to inform them of your intent.Illustrations are utilized by agents to highlight certain features of their policies.\u00a0 Illustrations should never be the only factor used in deciding to replace\u00a0 or change your policy. Illustrations that are presented for comparison purposes may not give a complete picture of the new policy\u2019s future.\u00a0 To ensure that your insurance policy meets your financial objectives, it is recommended that you obtain a second opinion, as well as consult with your current agent.\u00a0 Given the complexities involved in counseling a consumer regarding insurance purchases, you may want to inquire about the professional qualifications of your current agent and new agent.\u00a0 \u00a0Back to Top\nAnnuities\nWhile life insurance proceeds are paid at the time of death of the insured, the proceeds of an annuity can provide you with an income for as long as you live. There are two types of annuities:\n\nThe first is when you pay a lump sum to a life insurance company, and they pay it out to you right away in periodic installments.\u00a0 This type is known as an immediate annuity \u2014 the payments to you start immediately.\u00a0The second, and more common, is where money paid by you accumulates with interest over a period of time.\u00a0 If you choose, the accumulated amounts will then be paid out to you in periodic installments, usually when you retire, in order to supplement your retirement income.\u00a0 This type is known as a deferred annuity \u2014 the payments to you are deferred for a number of years.\u00a0 Currently, a deferred annuity may have tax advantages, in that the interest credited to your funds is deferred from current taxation.\u00a0 That is to say, income tax is not owed until you start receiving distributions from the annuity.Both types of annuities offer you certain options for receiving your income.\u00a0 It is usually paid to you monthly.\u00a0 The most common options are:\nLife Annuity - The company will pay you an income for as long as you live.\nPeriod Certain Annuity - The company will pay you an income for a specified amount of time (5 years, 10 years, 20 years, etc.). \nLife Annuity with Period Certain -The company will pay you an income for as long as you live, but if you die before the period certain that you choose, the income will be paid to a survivor you designate until the end of that period.\nJoint and Survivor Annuity - The company will pay an income to you during your life, and after your death will pay a percentage of that income (50% or 75%, for example) to a survivor you designate during his or her life. \u00a0\nDeferred Annuities\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on deferred annuities.\u00a0 If you are going to make an informed choice when you buy a deferred annuity, you need to understand which kinds are available.\u00a0 If one type does not seem to fit your needs, find out about the other contracts that are described in this guide.\u00a0 If you need more information than is given here, you should check with a life insurance agent or company, or consult books on life insurance which are available at your public library.\u00a0 Also, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) has a toll-free Hotline listed in this guide to assist you.\nBack to Top\nChoosing the Type of Deferred Annuity\nThere are two basic types of deferred annuities: fixed annuities and variable annuities. There are several variations on them.\nFixed Annuities guarantee that your money will accumulate at a minimum specified rate of interest.\u00a0 However, the company will pay you a higher rate of interest if its investment experience is better than the minimum guarantee.\nVariable Annuitiesdiffer from fixed annuities in that contract owners direct the distribution of their money among several different accounts and their accumulated funds reflect the experience of those accounts rather than that of the company.\u00a0 Typical account choices are common stock, bond, mortgage or money-market accounts.\u00a0 If the value of the accounts increases or decreases, so will the amount accumulated. Variable annuities are more risky to the contract owner than fixed annuities, but there is a possibility of greater returns. Other types of deferred annuities combine the characteristics of fixed and variable annuities. Annuities are sometimes sold as alternatives to investment vehicles such as certificates of deposit, money market accounts, mutual funds, etc.\u00a0 There are differences between these products. If you die during the surrender charge period, the surrender charges are deducted from the amount the beneficiary receives.\u00a0 You\u202fshould consult with your investment and/or tax advisor before making any decisions on purchasing this product.If you die during the accumulation phase of a deferred annuity, an amount usually at least equal to the amount you have accumulated will be paid to your beneficiary.\u00a0 If you cancel the contract, or take some money out of it, there may be surrender charges deducted from the accumulation value.\u00a0 The amount you receive is usually referred to as the cash value.\u00a0 It is usually not a good idea to purchase a deferred annuity unless you are planning to keep it for more than just a few years.\nBanks and Brokerage Firms\nProducts developed by life insurance companies are sometimes marketed through banks and brokerage firms.\u00a0 The person who sells you a life insurance policy or annuity should be a licensed life insurance agent, and in the case of a variable annuity, a licensed securities dealer.\u00a0 If you purchase an annuity through these sources, you should ask for the name of the insurance company, since they are the ones who will be managing your money. life insurance agent, and in the case of a variable annuity, a licensed securities dealer. If you purchase an annuity through these sources, you should ask for the name of the insurance company, since they are the ones who will be managing your money.\nFinding a Good Buy\nGuarantees\nA fixed deferred annuity always contain guarantees.\u00a0 For\u202fexample, it might guarantee that the interest rate on the\u202ffunds accumulating in your policy will be at least 2%.\u00a0 The guarantees are conservative, so that the company will be able to pay you the guaranteed amounts, even if conditions are very bad.\u00a0 Today, most companies pay greater amounts than they guarantee, but do not promise to continue to do that indefinitely.\u00a0 If you are shown any tables of numbers illustrating how the annuity might grow in the future, you should keep in mind that the non-guaranteed numbers could turn out to be lower or higher than those shown.You should also ask questions about the amounts you will receive if you decide to surrender your annuity, and find out the difference between the accumulation value and the amount you will receive.\u00a0 It is important to make sure that you receive all guarantees in writing for both life insurance and annuities. \nBack to Top\nOther Useful Information\nSuitability\nOnly buy an annuity if it is suitable for your circumstances. Consider your purpose in purchasing an annuity and whether an annuity is the best vehicle for achieving your financial goals. Make sure you are buying an annuity that fits your goals and circumstances.You should consider:The extent to which purchasing an annuity will tie up your money and whether you will need to pay surrender charges to access sufficient funds to pay for living expenses, including emergencies which may arise in the future;Your age; income; liquidity needs; financial time horizon; intended use of the annuity; The extent\u00a0 to which the annuity allows you access to your money in the future without your having to pay surrender charges or other penalties;The values, benefits, and costs of your existing investments as compared to those of the recommended annuity contract. The law requires insurance agents to ask you questions about your financial situation to make sure the annuity you are purchasing is suitable for your needs and circumstances. Insurance companies and insurance agents are prohibited from selling you an annuity unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the annuity is suitable based on the information you provide to the agent.\u00a0\nAgents\nLife insurance agents are licensed by the State, and may represent one or more companies.\u00a0 If you use an agent, choose carefully.\u00a0 Agents earn a commission on your business, and should do more for you than just sell you a life insurance policy or annuity contract.\u00a0 They should assess your individual needs, answer your insurance questions, and help you establish your goals. If you are considering the purchase of a variable annuity, the agent should have an insurance license and a registration with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)to sell variable products, which are considered to be securities.\u00a0 You should receive a\u202fprospectus describing the investment alternatives available to you. \u00a0\nReliability and Stability of Companies\n\u00a0In the past, high-risk investment strategies have threatened the solvency of some companies and thus the safety of policy benefits.\u00a0 Be sure to check out independent rating services\u2019 rating of any life insurance company you are considering before purchasing a life insurance policy or annuity contract.\u00a0 Also make sure that your life insurance company is licensed in California.\u00a0 Owners of annuity contracts or life insurance policies issued by companies licensed in California may be partially protected by the California Life and Health Insurance Guarantee Association (CLHIGA) in the event of the failure of the insurer.\u00a0 If you need further information on CLHIGA or California Insurance Code Section 1067.02 (c) that explains the monetary protection under CLHIGA, then contact the CDI via the methods provided on the last page of this brochure.\u00a0\nBack to Top\nInformation Sources\nAdditional information about life insurance companies can be found by reading insurance company rating services reports.
