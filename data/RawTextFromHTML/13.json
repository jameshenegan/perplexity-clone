Unlike permanent life insurance, which is designed to offer lifelong protection, term life insurance ends once the term expires. However, there are options to extend coverage through policy renewals or conversions, which can be critical in maintaining continuous protection without the need to purchase a new policy. Understanding what happens if you outlive your term life insurance is essential for planning your financial future. At Bankrate, we leverage our extensive expertise in the insurance industry to guide you through your options and help you make informed decisions about your coverage.\nWhat happens when term life insurance expires?\nWhen term life insurance expires, you might find that you still need coverage for various reasons. While it\u2019s common to purchase term coverage with the expectation that your financial responsibilities will decrease over time, circumstances like ongoing debts, dependents still needing support or new financial obligations may prompt you to extend your coverage.\nIf a term policy expires, it typically ends without any action needed from the policyholder. The insurance carrier sends a notice, premiums stop and there is no longer a death benefit. If the policy included a return-of-premium feature, the policyholder would receive a check for the premiums paid during the term.\nAdditionally, some term policies offer the option to renew on a year-by-year basis after the initial term expires. Renewal maintains the original coverage amount but is typically more expensive each year due to age-related risk increases. This option is particularly useful for those who develop health issues that make obtaining new insurance challenging.\nIf life finds you needing permanent coverage after all, many term policies include a conversion rider. This allows you to change your term policy into a permanent policy without needing to go through underwriting again. Conversion riders have an expiration date, however. Not all policies let you convert up until the end of the term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare life insurance providers quickly and easily\nSee which provider is right for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\n\n\n\nCaret Down Icon\nCaret Up Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select age\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage amount\n\n\nThe amount of coverage you need depends on many factors, including your age, income, mortgage and other debts and anticipated funeral expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaret Down Icon\nCaret Up Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select Coverage amount\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy type\n\n\n\nWhole life insurance combines life insurance with an investment component.\n\nCoverage for life\nTax-deferred savings benefit if premiums are paid\n3 variations of permanent insurance: whole life, universal life and variable life include investment component\n\nTerm life insurance is precisely what the name implies: an insurance policy that is good for a specific term of time.\n\nFixed premium over term\nNo savings benefits\nOutliving policy or policy cancellation results in no money back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaret Down Icon\nCaret Up Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select Policy type\n\n\n\n\nZIP Code\n\n\n\n\nLocation-Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour information is secure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind matches\n\n\nPowered by Coverage.com (NPN: 19966249)\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising disclosure\n\n\n\nThis advertisement is powered by Coverage.com, LLC, a licensed insurance producer (NPN: 19966249) and a corporate affiliate of Bankrate.

That way, you\u2019ll have time to take advantage of your policy\u2019s conversion rider if it\u2019s offered and makes sense for your circumstances. It is important to note here that you typically cannot add a conversion rider once the policy is in force. It\u2019s either included from the start or not, depending on the insurer.\nTerm conversion\nAs mentioned previously, many term policies include a term conversion rider, allowing you to convert your term policy into a permanent one without a medical exam. The timeframe for this conversion varies by policy. Some policies only allow conversion within a specific period, such as the first few years, while others permit conversion until the end of the term. For instance, a 20-year term policy might limit conversion to the first 15 years. These conversion limitations typically apply if you want to convert without providing evidence of insurability. If you wish to convert outside the specified period, you will usually need to go through medical underwriting.\nTerm conversion is a strategic choice for those who develop a health condition or become otherwise uninsurable but still need life insurance after their term policy ends. Instead of applying for a new policy, which could be more expensive due to health changes, converting an existing term policy can be a cost-effective option. Conversion rates are based on the original risk class awarded when the policy was first taken out, typically without requiring a new medical exam.\nHowever, permanent life insurance is inherently more expensive, and premiums will rise with conversion due to increased age. Many insurers offer partial conversions to make this transition more affordable. For example, converting a $500,000 term policy entirely might significantly increase premiums, so you might opt to convert $250,000 instead, balancing the need for permanent coverage with manageable payments.\nUnderstanding your policy\u2019s conversion options and any conversion deadlines at the time of purchase can help you plan more effectively and hopefully streamline your continuous coverage for you and your loved ones.\nRenew your term coverage\nMost term life insurance policies offer the option to renew for a limited number of years without requiring evidence of insurability. This means you can extend your coverage even if your health has changed. For instance, a 10-year term policy may be renewable each year for up to 10 additional years. During each renewal, your premium will increase based on your current age.\nAlthough premiums for renewed policies typically significantly increase each year, this renewability option is especially beneficial if you develop serious health issues, as it ensures continued financial protection for your family without needing a new medical exam. The increase in premiums due to age at renewal is usually less significant than the potential increase or inability to secure a new policy if you were to reapply after being diagnosed with a serious health condition. This makes the renewability feature a valuable safeguard against the uncertainties of future health issues.\nPurchase a new term policy\nFor the relatively young who are in good health, the most inexpensive life insurance option might be to purchase a new term policy. Premium costs may also go down if a much lower death benefit and a shorter term are purchased, which may be a good option for people who need less coverage than when they purchased their initial term policy.\nFor example, for someone whose youngest child is still in high school when their 20-year term policy expires, an additional 10-year policy may be sufficient to ensure that their dependent has completed college and no longer needs financial support from their parents\u2019 income.\nKeep in mind that a medical exam will likely be part of the underwriting process for any new term policy, and if there are new health issues since the first policy, the rate will likely increase. Age is also a factor \u2014 older people pay more for their term life insurance policies.\nPurchase a permanent policy\nAnother option for those without a term conversion rider is to purchase a permanent life insurance policy after the term policy expires. Permanent life insurance policies, such as whole life insurance, are more expensive than term life insurance \u2014 sometimes up to ten times more costly. However, the cost can vary based on personal factors and policy choices. Overlooking cost for a second, here are some benefits of permanent life insurance:\n\n\nLifetime coverage: Permanent policies provide coverage for the policyholder\u2019s entire life, as long as premiums are paid. However, lifetime in this context typically falls between the ages of 95 and 121, the maximum coverage age range insurers typically set.\n\nCash value component: These policies include a tax-deferred cash value component, which grows over time. The cash value can be used as collateral for a loan or withdrawn.\n\nSafe investment: While the cash value component may not earn as much interest as some other investments like the stock market, it is generally considered safe and can be an important part of financial planning \u2014 but typically should not be your primary means of saving for retirement. Life insurance is insurance, not an investment product.\n\nThere are also several different types of permanent life insurance, each with unique features. Here are the common products you will come across:\n\n\nWhole life insurance: Offers fixed premiums, a guaranteed death benefit and a cash value component that grows at a guaranteed rate.\n\nUniversal life insurance: Provides flexible premiums and death benefits, with a cash value component that earns interest based on current market rates or a fixed rate.\n\nIndexed universal life insurance: Similar to universal life but with a cash value component tied to a stock market index, providing potential for higher returns.\n\nVariable universal life insurance: Combines the flexible features of universal life insurance with investment options for the cash value component, allowing policyholders to invest in various sub-accounts.\n\nAlthough permanent policies are not recommended for everyone due to their higher cost, they can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, they may be ideal for individuals with a child with a disability who will never be financially independent or a non-working partner who would need financial support if the primary earner dies.\nFinal expense insurance\nThe median cost of a funeral in the United States is $7,848. For those who don\u2019t want to burden their heirs with end-of-life expenses and don\u2019t need a significant payout, one type of permanent insurance to consider is final expenses or burial insurance. Final expense life insurance often has low coverage limits capped at $10,000 or $25,000, so it\u2019s not the best option for income replacement. Additionally, the premiums tend to be comparatively expensive because a medical exam is not required and the insurance company assumes more risk. As with similar forms of insurance, cost will go up for more coverage and will also rise with the policyholder\u2019s age.\nFinal expense insurance can be a good choice for older adults whose primary goal is to prevent their beneficiaries from facing financial challenges associated with their death. It may also be suitable for people with pre-existing health conditions, or those who have been denied standard life insurance in the past.\nDo I still need life insurance?\nAs your term life insurance policy nears its expiration, it can be helpful to evaluate whether you still need life insurance coverage. Your need for continued coverage will depend on various personal and financial factors.\nIf your term coverage is ending, you may still need life insurance if you have:\n\n\nDependents still relying on your income: If you still have dependents who rely on your income for their living expenses, education or other needs, maintaining life insurance coverage can help provide financial security for them.\n\nOutstanding debts: If you have significant debts, such as a mortgage, car loans or other financial obligations, life insurance can help make sure these debts are paid off without burdening your loved ones.\n\nBusiness obligations: If you own a business, life insurance can help with business succession planning, covering key persons or repaying business loans in the event of your death.\n\nSignificant wealth: Life insurance can be a tool for estate planning, providing liquidity to pay estate taxes or leave a financial legacy for heirs.\n\nSpecial needs dependents: If you have a dependent with special needs who will require lifelong financial support, life insurance can ensure their needs are met even after you are gone.\n\nOn the other hand, you might not need life insurance in these scenarios:\n\n\nFinancial independence of dependents: If your children or other dependents are financially independent, you may no longer have a need for life insurance coverage.\n\nPaid-off debts: If you have paid off your major debts and have sufficient savings or other assets to cover any remaining obligations, continuing life insurance might be unnecessary.\n\nRetirement savings: If you have adequate retirement savings and other investments to cover your and your spouse\u2019s living expenses, you may not need additional life insurance coverage.\n\nSpouse\u2019s financial stability: If your spouse or partner is financially secure and capable of maintaining their lifestyle without your income, the need for life insurance may be reduced.\n\nAssessing your current financial situation and future needs is critical in determining whether to maintain or purchase new life insurance coverage. Consider consulting with a financial advisor or licensed insurance professional to help you make an informed decision based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\nWhat is the best life insurance company?\nCaret DownThe best life insurance company for you will be a personal decision, based on your unique characteristics and coverage needs. Speaking with an independent insurance agent can be a good first step toward identifying the best life insurance companies to fit your budget, health and overall situation.\n\n\n\nWhich type of policy is better: term or permanent?\nCaret DownChoosing between term and permanent life insurance can be challenging. Each type has its own benefits, and the right choice often depends on your individual needs and financial situation.\n\nTerm life insurance: Term policies are generally more affordable, especially when you are young. In terms of how long term life insurance is, policies typically offer coverage for a specific period, such as 10, 20 or 30 years. This makes them a good option for people who need coverage for a limited time, like until their children graduate from college or their mortgage is paid off. However, term policies do not build cash value, and coverage ends when the term expires.\n\nPermanent life insurance: Permanent policies, including whole life and universal life, offer lifelong coverage as long as premiums are paid. These policies also include a cash value component, which grows over time and can be used as collateral for loans or withdrawn, though withdrawals may reduce the death benefit. Permanent life insurance is generally more expensive than term life insurance but provides both insurance protection and a financial asset.\n\nWhen deciding between term and permanent life insurance, consider your long-term financial goals, your budget and whether you want coverage for a specific period or for your entire life.\n\n\n\n\nDo I need life insurance if I have no dependents?\nCaret DownEven if you do not have dependents, you still may want to consider a life insurance policy. Many people choose to purchase a policy with their spouse as the beneficiary to assist that person with the burden of end-of-life costs. You may also choose to leave your policy\u2019s death benefit to a nonprofit organization, educational institution or business you care about.\n\n\n\nCan you cancel a life insurance policy?\nCaret DownYes, you can cancel a life insurance policy at any time. If you have a term policy, you can either formally cancel with your insurance company, or you can simply stop paying the premiums. With permanent life insurance, however, the cancellation process can be more complicated. You typically have to start the cancellation process by notifying your insurance company. Depending on how long the policy has been in force, you might be required to pay a surrender fee. In most cases, you are allowed to keep the cash value when you cancel a permanent life insurance policy, but the cancellation fees will be subtracted from your final payout. Check your specific policy or speak with your insurance agent to learn more about the process and any potential penalties for canceling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Icon \n      Cite us\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Icon \n            Share this article\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nShare Icon \n                Share this article\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Icon \n\n\n\nTwitter Icon \n\n\n\nLinkedIn Icon \n\n\n\nEmail Envelope Icon \n\n\nClose\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Written by\n            \n\n                Ashlyn Brooks\n                \nArrow Right Icon \n\n\n                Writer II, Insurance\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Read more from Ashlyn\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n            Ashlyn Brooks is a finance writer with more than half a decade of experience, known for her knowledge in areas such as taxes, insurance, investing, retirement, finance news, and banking products.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You may also like\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Annuities vs. life insurance: What\u2019s the difference?\n                    \n\n\n\n                        Retirement\n                    \n\n\n\n\nBy James Royal, Ph.D.\n\n6 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Term vs whole life insurance\n                    \n\n\n\n                        Life Insurance\n                    \n\n\n\n\nBy Ashlyn Brooks\n\n16 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What happens if your life insurance beneficiary dies before you?\n                    \n\n\n\n                        Life Insurance\n                    \n\n\n\n\nBy Ashlyn Brooks\n\n6 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What happens to your life insurance when you leave a job?\n                    \n\n\n\n                        Life Insurance\n                    \n\n\n\n\nBy Ashlyn Brooks\n\n5 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBankrate logo\n\nBankrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\n\n\nPress room\n\n\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\nSite map\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nCompare rates\n\n\n\n\nLatest news\n\n\n\n\nPopular topics\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\nCookie settings\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Health Information Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Bankrate\u2019s averages\n\n\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\n\nGLBA annual notice\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Consumer Financial Privacy Notice\n\n\n\n\nLicenses\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we make money\n\nBankrate.com is an independent, advertising-supported publisher and comparison service.

However, these policies eventually expire, which can leave your loved ones vulnerable. Fortunately, there are many ways to maintain or replace that coverage. Read on to learn how term life insurance works, what happens when it expires, and what options you have to continue coverage when your policy ends.\nHow term life insurance works\nA term life insurance plan can offer policyholders coverage for a set period, called the term length. Many insurers usually offer term lengths of 10 to 30 years. If you pass away while your plan is active, your loved ones will receive the death benefit. Premiums are reasonable since these policies are simple, lack cash value, and do not last for your lifetime.1 As a result, a term life insurance policy from Aflac can help provide you and your loved ones with substantial financial protection at a rate that fits your budget.\nWhat happens at the end of a policyholder\u2019s term life insurance policy?\nWhen your term life insurance plan expires, the policy\u2019s coverage ends, and you stop paying premiums. Therefore, if you pass away after the policy ends, your beneficiaries will not be eligible to receive a death benefit.2\nSome policyholders may only need term life insurance for a certain timeframe, such as to help protect a child until they reach adulthood and start their career. In this case, letting the policy expire without getting new coverage may be feasible. However, some may find that they\u2019ll still need life insurance coverage, so they\u2019ll have to get a new policy.\nCan you get your money back after your term life policy expires?\nOnce your policy ends, you can\u2019t get back the premiums you paid unless you have a return of premium rider. This optional add-on lets you receive a refund of premiums if you outlive your policy term.3 However, a return of premium rider can increase your premiums, so you must budget accordingly when adding one.\n\n\n\n\nPeace of mind doesn't have to break the bank\nDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Help cover yourself and your family with coverage from Aflac.\n\nGet a Quote\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do after your term life insurance policy expires\nHere are some options you have to remain covered after your term life insurance policy ends:4\nConvert your policy\nTerm life insurance often lets you convert your policy to a permanent life plan for higher premiums. This policy type lasts for your entire life if you remain current on your premiums. It also comes with a cash value growth component that can help serve as a wealth-building vehicle.\nEvery time you pay premiums, the insurer puts part of your payment into the cash value. It can grow tax-deferred at a certain rate, depending on the policy type. For example, Aflac\u2019s whole life insurance policies helps grow your cash value at a fixed, guaranteed rate.\nAs you accumulate cash value, you can borrow against it or withdraw from it. Plus, if you no longer need coverage and surrender your policy, your insurer can pay you the cash value minus surrender charges. Keep in mind that using your cash value in these ways may incur tax consequences.\nThe lifelong coverage and cash value make permanent life insurance premiums more expensive than term life insurance.1 However, these benefits can be worth the higher cost for those who want added peace of mind and wealth-building opportunities.\nExtend your current policy\nMany insurers attach renewal riders to term life insurance. This lets you extend your coverage without new underwriting or medical exams. Remember that premiums will be higher since you\u2019ll be older when renewing your policy. Furthermore, you may have to stick with the same term length the original policy had.\nGet a new term life policy\nIf your term life insurance expires and it\u2019s too late to renew or extend coverage, you can buy a new term life insurance policy. This may allow you more flexibility in choosing the policy term, but you\u2019ll likely have to take a new medical exam to get coverage. Additionally, you may pay more in premiums since you\u2019ll be older when applying, but your premiums may be less than if you renewed the policy.\nGet permanent life insurance\nIf your term life insurance has already expired and it\u2019s too late to convert it, you can still purchase a permanent life insurance policy. However, traditional policies may require a medical exam. Fortunately, some policies are available with no medical exam, such as final expense insurance from Aflac.\nGet a life insurance quote\nIf your term life insurance plan is expiring soon, evaluate your options so that you can continue coverage seamlessly. Whether you renew your coverage, convert to a permanent life insurance policy, or take out a new policy, understanding the pros and cons of your options is vital to making the best decision.\nAflac offers term and whole life insurance to help replace your old coverage if you need a new policy.

date.\u00a0 A\u00a0 policy typically lasts between 5 to 30 years and renews at that time at a higher premium. In cases where policyholders outlive their policy, their options include renewing their policy, choosing to forego life insurance and cancelling their policy, finding new coverage at a lower premium, or converting their coverage to whole life insurance policy.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy Parmeet Singh\nInsurance Advisor, LLQP\n\n\n\n   10 min read\n January 22nd, 2024\n\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\nDo you still need life insurance when your term expires?\n\n\nMaking the decision to let coverage lapse\n\n\nWhat to do when you still need coverage at the end of your term\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost term life insurance policies come with an expiry date, upon which the policy matures and your coverage ends. Generally, one can only own a term policy for a set period time; which can last anywhere between 5 and 30 years depending on your policy. While the policy is in force, you must pay a monthly premium to guarantee the death benefit to your beneficiaries if you die.\nBut people don\u2019t purchase term life insurance policies in the hopes of a big payout. The entire point is to provide a financial safety net for your loved ones to fall back on if you happen to pass away unexpectedly.\nSo what happens if you outlive your policy? What if your plan expires while you\u2019re still alive and kicking?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed insurance answers now?\n\n\nCall 1-888-601-9980 to speak to our licensed advisors right away, or book some time with them below.\n\n\nSCHEDULE A CALL\n\n\nA term life insurance policy is usually bought only for short term obligation \u2013 to provide for dependents until they start earning and pay off pending loans and mortgages. It\u2019s possible you won\u2019t need the insurance coverage once your term period is up.\nBut this doesn\u2019t always apply to everyone\u2019s situation. People often end up requiring extended insurance coverage due to unforeseen circumstances. Fortunately, for those who need life insurance upon the expiration of their initial term policy, there are multiple options.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do when your term life insurance expires\nAs we mentioned, people sign up for a term life insurance policy with the hope that they never need to use it. But many feel it is a necessary investment to make to keep your family\u2019s financial future secure. This same frame of mind is required when exploring your options when your coverage has ended.\nYou need to assess your latest financial situation. Do you still have dependents? Is your estate sufficient enough to sustain them into adulthood? Is your mortgage still pending? Does your partner depend on your income to main their quality of life? Only an honest introspection into your finances can help you understand these future needs.\nIf you determine that you\u2019ll need continued coverage then broach this conversation with your insurance advisor or broker 6 months before the maturity date. Any later and you risk getting caught in a coverage gap. This gives you enough time to study all the available options and choose the one that is best for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I decide against life insurance coverage if I outlive my current policy?\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to not require any more insurance coverage, then all you need to do is pay the last premium and wait out the policy. Once the plan ends, you won\u2019t be covered and nor will your beneficiaries receive any payout upon your death. Of course, that means you no longer need to pay your monthly premium as well.\nIf your children are well on their way to providing for themselves, you\u2019re completely debt-free, and your partner is capable of maintaining their expenses without your income it doesn\u2019t make much sense to continue paying for a term policy you may not need.\nBut letting your coverage lapse entirely is not the advised course of action for most policyholders if you still have obligations \u2013 including those listed above \u2013 and have not saved up the cash to cover them at that time.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I do if I still need life insurance after the expiry of my term?\nOver the years, your net worth might have risen or you may have fewer financial obligations. In many cases, your coverage requirements will have changed from the time you bought your first term policy.\nDoing a financial assessment with a life insurance needs calculator is an important step in understanding your pending coverage needs.\nIf you find you\u2019re still in the market for life insurance once your policy ends then you have 3 options.\n\nRenew your term with your current insurance provider.\nConvert your current policy into whole life insurance.\nBuy a completely new term life insurance policy.\n\nBelow is a detailed explanation of each option with its pros and cons to help you make the right choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenew current term life insurance\nMany term life insurance companies offer the choice to extend the policy term beyond the initially agreed date. This is referred to as a renewability rider and may have been touted as a feature of your policy when you first purchased it. This extension is usually valid until you reach a certain age (generally 75 years), though it varies from company to company.\nHow do I renew my term life insurance policy?\nIf you like your current coverage and don\u2019t mind paying more expensive premiums, then renewing your term life insurance policy is an easy choice.\nYou are saved from the hassle of shopping for a new policy and you don\u2019t need to spend time researching and discussing with your loved ones about a new term policy. All that is required of you is to continue paying the newly set premiums.\nAnother positive part of a renewable policy is that you\u2019re exempt from displaying proof of insurability. Simply put, you won\u2019t need to undergo an extensive medical exam to qualify for the insurance policy again. This is ideal for those who have experienced drastic declines in health during the term of the first policy. Having a permanent medical condition or just generally poor health is seen as a potential risk by most leading insurance companies that can possibly disqualify you from purchasing a new policy.\nAs mentioned, the benefits of renewing a policy come at a much higher cost. The revised premium to be paid with a policy renewal can be 5-10 times more expensive than your previous coverage. This is to cover the lack of proof of insurability. The insurance provider has no way of knowing how healthy you are without a medical examination. There is an assumption that your health deteriorates during the previous term.\nIf you\u2019re in relatively good health with no long term medical issues, then you should consider foregoing renewal. Instead, you could opt for a brand new policy which we\u2019ll explain later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert current term life insurance into permanent life insurance\nConvertibility is another rider that some insurance companies offer as part of a base term life insurance policy. Once the term is up, you have the choice to convert your term policy into a whole life insurance plan.\nThe biggest difference between term life and whole life insurance is the added cash value it brings. Whole life insurance can be treated like an investment or financial vehicle to reduce your tax burden. All the cash that you put into your converted whole life insurance coverage accrues value over time and provides a guaranteed death benefit for your entire life.\nHow do I convert my term life insurance policy to permanent coverage?\nIf you choose to convert your policy, you will not only retain your coverage but also provide your beneficiaries with a large death benefit after you pass.\nAs with renewability, this rider does not require proof of insurability. No medical examinations, check-ups, or intrusive questions are asked. This policy is perfect for those with permanent medical conditions or diseases which prevent them from qualifying for a new policy.\nBut \u2013 similar to renewability \u2013 with these benefits come higher premiums. You can expect your premiums to go up substantially when you convert to whole life insurance.\nAnother possible downside is that converted policies are only eligible for selected permanent policies. That means you might not get to choose a specific policy provided by the company. Instead, your range of choices is limited to the ones the company included in your rider.\nAnother way to lower the premiums when converting to a whole life policy is by reducing your death benefit. If you feel a lower coverage will suit your needs just as well, then you can select a partial conversion wherein you retain some form of coverage with lower premiums.\nChoosing to convert your term life insurance policy into a permanent policy can be the best alternative if your health has worsened during your initial term. But if your financial situation has dramatically altered, then a brand new policy with coverage that suits your new requirements may suit you better.\n\n\n\n\nMore choice. Lower price.\nPolicyAdvisor saves you time and money when comparing Canada\u2019s top life insurance companies. Check it out!\nGET STARTED\n\n\n\nBuy a brand new life insurance policy\nOnly you can decide whether buying a brand new insurance policy is the right decision. If your financial needs have stayed level or increased, then considering a new policy with the right amount of coverage can be a smart option.\nAs with other choices, discuss your insurance needs with an experienced insurance advisor well before your policy expiry date. They can help you determine whether applying for new coverage is financially prudent. Even if you are rejected by an insurance provider for health-related reasons, the buffer time can be used to apply for a renewal with your current provider.\nHow do I buy a brand new life insurance policy?\nShopping for a new policy requires work. But there are many advantages to choosing new coverage.\nFirstly, there are several types of policies available to choose from such as a term life insurance, no medical and guaranteed policies, whole life insurance, and universal life insurance among many others. When renewing or converting existing coverage you are limited to the types of policies and coverage your current provider offers.\nSecondly, if you are in relatively good health, applying for fully medically underwritten coverage will generally have a much lower monthly premium compared to similar coverage that was renewed or converted. Because the insurance provider is setting the rates based on your health, you no longer have to pay for the risk involved in their uncertainty about your health.\nLastly, you can get as much or little coverage as you need at this time. Instead of being bound by the coverage amounts that are tied to your previous coverage you can take on a smaller policy to save money, or get more coverage for new obligations in your life (such as a new home or taking care of children or grandchildren).\n\n\n\n\nWeighing your insurance options\nOutliving your term life insurance can be considered good news. We want to live for as long as comfortably possible.\nBut it also brings forth the dilemma of considering whether to forego life insurance or not. If your dependents are now self-sufficient and your own retirement plans are in place, then you can simply let your policy expire upon maturity.\nBut if this is not the case, you need to consider new coverage. The best option for a relatively healthy person is buying a brand new policy to keep the cost of premiums as low as possible. If a medical condition makes a new policy difficult or unaffordable, then take advantage of the guaranteed riders in your initial policy. Most importantly, speak with an experienced insurance advisor to explore all your option and see where you can save money while maintaining the coverage you need.\n\n\n\nNeed help?\nCall us at 1-888-601-9980 or book time with our licensed experts.\nSCHEDULE A CALL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n\nTerm life insurance is a temporary protection meant to cover an insured person (or their dependents) financial risk should something happen to them.\nRenewing or converting an existing term life insurance policy can be expensive, but may be one's only choice for coverage if they have accrued any health issues during their coverage period.\nOne can save money by applying for life insurance again rather than renewing their policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Parmeet Singh\nInsurance Advisor, LLQP\n\n\n\nConnect with author \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind this informative?

He is also the author of two books.\n\n\n\nLearn about our \neditorial policies\n\n\n\nUpdated May 28, 2022\n\n\n\nReviewed by\nEric Estevez\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n Unlike permanent life insurance, term life insurance stays in effect for only a certain period of time\u2014such as 10, 20, or 30 years.\n\n\n If you die during that period, your beneficiary will receive a payout from the insurance company. If you die after the policy has expired, there will be no payout.\n\n\n So what should you do if your term expires and you still need life insurance?\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIf your term insurance policy is expiring and you still have dependents relying on your income, you may need new insurance.\nYou might have the option to continue your current policy on an annual basis, but that could be expensive.\nSome term life insurance policies can be converted into permanent life insurance.\nIf you\u2019re in reasonably good health, you may be able to find an affordable policy.\nSome insurance companies write policies for applicants up to age 90. \n\n  Understanding Term Life Insurance  \n The principal purpose of life insurance is to provide financial support for your dependents should you die prematurely. For example, someone might buy a 30-year term policy at age 40, figuring that by the time they reach 70, their kids will be grown up, out of the house, and self-supporting.\n\n\n The advantage of term insurance over whole life and other forms of permanent insurance is that it\u2019s cheaper, so the same amount of money can get the policyholder a larger death benefit. The disadvantage is that it eventually expires, at which point the policyholder, now older, may find it difficult to buy another policy.\n\n\n For many, this is not a problem. However, suppose that our hypothetical 40-year-old with a 30-year term policy is approaching age 70 and still has dependents. Perhaps one of their children has had unforeseen physical or psychological problems and can\u2019t be self-supporting. Or perhaps the policyholder is now responsible for supporting a grandchild.\n\n\n In such cases, the policyholder might want to try to keep some life insurance. So what exactly are the options?\n\n\n  What to Do If Your Policy Is Expiring  \n You will have the most options if your policy is still in force and hasn\u2019t reached the end of its term. Ideally, it\u2019s best to make plans at least a year before that point. Here are some steps to consider.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic reportedly caused many insurers to reevaluate their life insurance products for older people, who are more vulnerable to dying from the disease. Until the pandemic ends, you may have fewer options or encounter higher prices than you would otherwise.\n  Extend Your Coverage  \n Many term policies have a guaranteed renewability provision that allows you to keep your insurance in effect after the end of the original term as long as you continue to pay the premiums. While your premiums are likely to rise each year\u2014perhaps considerably\u2014 based on your current age, you typically won\u2019t have to submit to a new physical exam.\n\n\n Some policies allow you to renew on this basis up to age 95.\n\n\n  Convert to a Permanent Policy  \n Your term policy may also include a provision for converting to a whole life or universal life policy, again without a physical exam. The new insurance policy could continue for the rest of your life or as long as you need it.\n\n\n The premium on the new policy will be higher than you have been paying for term insurance. Still, you may have the option of converting to a policy with a smaller death benefit in return for a lower premium if that works for you.\n\n\n Policies differ in terms of when you can make this switch (there may be age limits). You\u2019ll need to check your policy or contact your insurance company or agent to find out.\n\n\n  Shop Around for a New Policy  \n If you\u2019re reaching the end of your current term policy, don\u2019t automatically assume that you can\u2019t get a new one because of your age. Some insurers write policies for people up to the age of 80.\n\n\n You will typically need to have a medical exam, especially if the policy is for over a certain amount, such as $50,000. Some lower-value policies don\u2019t require a physical.\n\n\n Financial advisors will often recommend you research the available policies for older consumers to find the best term life policy.\n\n\n  Combine Several Smaller Policies  \n If you have health issues that make it difficult for you to buy a sufficiently large term insurance policy, you may be able to cobble together a portfolio of smaller policies that will add to what you need.\n\n\n These policies may not require a physical exam, but they may ask for some health information.\n\n\n In addition to buying one or more small policies through an insurance agent or directly from insurance companies, you could be eligible for group life insurance through your employer, if you\u2019re still working, or through a trade association, college alumni club, or other organization to which you belong.\n\n\n  Buy a Burial Policy  \n Still another option is final expense or burial insurance. These are typically whole life policies with relatively small payouts, such as $20,000 or $25,000.\n\n\n They may require no medical exam and\u2014despite their grim name\u2014will provide money that your beneficiaries can use for any purpose.\n\n\n Do You Get Your Money Back At the End of a Term Life Insurance?\nNo. You purchased coverage for a period of time, and you got coverage for that time, whether or not it was used. When term life insurance ends, you do not get your money back.\n\n\n What Happens When a Term Life Insurance Policy Matures?\nWhen a term life insurance policy matures, your life insurance coverage on the policy ends. Some companies will allow you to extend your coverage or purchase permanent life insurance to replace it.\n\n\n Can You Extend Term Life Insurance?\nSome life insurance carriers allow you to extend your term life insurance.You may end up having to pay more in premiums, because of your age, or take a new health exam.\n\n\n What Happens After 20-Year Term Life Insurance?\nIf you take out a 20-year term life insurance policy and you die within the 20 years, your beneficiaries will receive your death benefit. If you do not die during the time period of the policy, it will expire after 20 years.\n\n\n What Happens to the Money After Term Life Insurance Expires?\nThe premiums you pay for your death benefit remain with the company after your term life insurance expires.\n\n\n  The Bottom Line  \n If you have a term life insurance policy that is due to expire in the near future, the first question is whether you still need insurance. If your former dependents no longer rely on your income, you may no longer need it.\n\n\n However, if you do need insurance, there are several ways to obtain it. If your health is iffy, your best bet may be to try to extend your current term life policy or convert to a permanent policy with that insurer. If you\u2019re in good health, it may pay to shop around for a new term life policy, which could prove more affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Sources\n\n\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
