It provides coverage for a set number of years, paying out as long as your policy hasn't expired and you've paid the premiums. You can lock in your rate for the entire term period, which makes budgeting and planning easier.\nAt the end of the term period, and based on the product options available, you may be able to renew your policy at an adjusted rate. However, you can typically only renew a term life policy on a year-to-year basis \u2014 not for another term period. Your new rate will be based on your age and health at the time of renewal, and you may or may not need a medical exam to obtain coverage. You may also be able to convert your term life policy to whole life at the end of your term.\nWhole life insurance\nWhole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that provides coverage for your entire lifetime, paying your benefit no matter when you pass away \u2014 as long as you keep paying your bill. Whole life insurance also includes a savings component that a portion of your premium will pay into. The savings component has a fixed interest rate that builds cash value over time, which is part of the reason whole life policies typically cost more than term life policies with similar coverage.\nThe cash value of your policy won't affect the death benefit paid out upon your passing. However, if it grows to equal your death benefit amount by the time you're a set age (usually 100 or 120), your insurer will terminate your policy and pay out the coverage amount.\nIf you're not banking on living to 100, you can withdraw some cash value funds as a life insurance loan. There's typically no credit check required and a minimal loan approval process. You repay the loan with interest, or if you pass away before returning the funds, the remaining loan amount and interest will be withdrawn from the payout to your beneficiaries.\nUniversal life insurance\nUniversal life insurance is another permanent life insurance option, providing coverage for your entire life as long as you pay the premiums. It's sometimes called adjustable life insurance because it offers more flexibility than a whole life policy. For example, universal life policies allow you to increase or decrease your death benefit and even adjust or skip your monthly premium (within certain limits).\nAs with whole life, a universal life policy has a savings component that grows and allows for borrowing. However, a universal life policy works differently than a whole life policy in two key ways:The interest rate for a universal life policy's cash value is not fixed. You'll have a guaranteed minimum interest rate, but in general, the rate at which your cash value builds can change over time based on market conditions.Your universal life policy's cash value can eventually grow and result in a zero-cost policy, in which all premiums are paid from the built-up value.Variable life insurance\u2020 \nVariable life insurance is a riskier type of permanent life insurance. A common variable life insurance policy design is built on two pieces:\nA face value death benefit: Just as with whole life and universal life, when you purchase a variable life policy, you'll select a fixed death benefit to be paid out upon your passing as long as you pay your premiums.\nA variable cash value: Your cash value will rise and fall based on your payments and the performance of your selected investments. Unlike with whole life, your variable life cash value can be part of your death benefit.\nThe greater range of investment options offered by a variable life policy means it could, in the long run, provide a greater benefit to your beneficiaries when you pass away \u2014 especially if you're a savvy investor. But it also opens you up to much higher risk, fees, and costs than whole life or universal life policies.\nFinal expense life insurance\nAlso known as funeral or burial insurance, final expense insurance is a type of whole life insurance that offers a smaller and more affordable death benefit designed to help cover your end-of-life expenses like funeral costs, medical bills, or outstanding debt. While other types of life insurance may have age and health requirements, final expense policies can be easier for older or less-healthy individuals to qualify for. A final expense policy's cash value operates the same as a whole life policy's, building value at a fixed rate over time.Pro tip:There are also different types of life insurance riders you can add to a policy to change how your life insurance works under certain circumstances.Other types of life insurance\nIndexed universal life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance with a cash value that grows based on a stock market index such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ. You can adjust your premium as the cash value of the policy increases, which can result in a policy whose cash value pays the premiums.Simplified issue life insurance is a type of life insurance that doesn\u2019t require a medical exam. This can be beneficial for healthy individuals who need a policy quickly because the approval process can be much faster. Depending on the insurer and policy, coverage could begin within minutes to a few days compared to a standard life insurance policy that could take a month or longer. This type of life insurance generally costs more and could have a smaller coverage amount due to the increased risk the insurer takes on by simplifying the application process.Instant life insurance is a specific type of simplified issue policy that you can apply for online and often get a decision within minutes. Instant life insurance is similar to simplified issue but may have higher and more affordable coverage options.Guaranteed life insurance is a type of policy that does not ask medical questions and your application cannot be turned down.\nOther kinds of non-traditional life insurance include:\nSupplemental life insurance can provide additional coverage beyond what your company's group life policy offers. You can purchase it from your employer (if offered) or a private insurance company for an additional premium.Survivorship life insurance covers two people on a single policy that pays a death benefit once both policyholders have passed away. A type of joint life insurance, survivorship policies can be part of an estate plan and a way to leave an inheritance for heirs.Decreasing term life insurance provides coverage with a death benefit that gets smaller over time, making the policy more affordable than a standard term policy because the payout diminishes.AD&D insurance is a category of life insurance that will only pay out if the insured person is in an accident that causes death or serious injuries such as the loss of limbs, sight, or paralysis.\nWhat type of life insurance is best for me?\nWhen choosing the type of life insurance that's best for you, consider where you are right now in life by asking yourself these questions:What is your age?Do you have people who depend on your income who would suffer if you were no longer around?What are your investment goals and estate planning goals, or do you just want coverage to pay for your final expenses?Consider how much coverage you'll need using Progressive's life insurance calculator, and what you can afford to pay each month.Get a free life insurance quote online in minutesGet a quoteOr, call 1-866-912-2477Learn more about life insurance policies.Related articlesTerm vs. whole life insurance 4 min to readWhat is the difference between whole life vs. universal life insurance? 3 min to readHow does life insurance work? 5 min to readRelated categoriesInsurance basicsTerms & definitionsHave more questions?

Life insurers offer various forms of term plans and traditional life policies as well as \"interest sensitive\" products which have become more prevalent since the 1980's . In New York State, the Department of Financial Services must approve any life insurance policy before a company can issue it to consumers and New York Insurance Law provides for standard provisions that must be included in every policy.\nTerm Insurance\nTerm insurance provides protection for a specified period of time. This period could be as short as one year or provide coverage for a specific number of years such as 5, 10, 20 years or to a specified age such as 80 or in some cases up to the oldest age in the life insurance mortality tables. Policies are sold with various premium guarantees. The longer the guarantee, the higher the initial premium. If you die during the term period, the company will pay the face amount of the policy to your beneficiary. If you live beyond the term period you had selected, no benefit is payable. As a rule, term policies offer a death benefit with no savings element or cash value.\nPremiums are locked in for the specified period of time under the policy terms. The premiums you pay for term insurance are lower at the earlier ages as compared with the premiums you pay for permanent insurance, but term rates rise as you grow older. Term plans may be \"convertible\" to a permanent plan of insurance. The coverage can be \"level\" providing the same benefit until the policy expires or you can have \"decreasing\" coverage during the term period with the premiums remaining the same. If you do not pay the premium for your term insurance policy, it will generally lapse without cash value, as compared to a permanent type of policy that has a cash value component. Currently term insurance rates are very competitive and among the lowest historically experienced.\nIt should be noted that it is a widely held belief that term insurance is the least expensive pure life insurance coverage available. One needs to review the policy terms carefully to decide which term life options are suitable to meet your particular circumstances.\nTypes of Term Insurance\n\nRenewable Term. Renewable term plans give you the right to renew for another period when a term ends, regardless of the state of your health. With each new term the premium is increased. The right to renew the policy without evidence of insurability is an important advantage to you. Otherwise, the risk you take is that your health may deteriorate and you may be unable to obtain a policy at the same rates or even at all, leaving you and your beneficiaries without coverage.\nConvertible Term. Convertible term policies often permit you to exchange the policy for a permanent plan. You must exercise this option during the conversion period. The length of the conversion period will vary depending on the type of term policy purchased. If you convert within the prescribed period, you are not required to give any information about your health. The premium rate you pay on conversion is usually based on your \"current attained age\", which is your age on the conversion date. This type of policy often provides the maximum protection with the smallest amount of cash outlay.\nLevel or Decreasing Term. Under a level term policy the face amount of the policy remains the same for the entire period. With decreasing term the face amount reduces over the period. The premium stays the same each year. Often such policies are sold as mortgage protection with the amount of insurance decreasing as the balance of the mortgage decreases. If the insured dies the proceeds of the policy can be used to pay off the mortgage.\nAdjustable Premium. Traditionally, insurers have not had the right to change premiums after the policy is sold. Since such policies may continue for many years, insurers must use conservative mortality, interest and expense rate estimates in the premium calculation. Adjustable premium insurance, however, allows insurers to offer insurance at lower \"current\" premiums based upon less conservative assumptions with the right to change these premiums in the future. The premium, however, can never be more than the maximum guaranteed premiums stated in the policy.\n\nPermanent Insurance (Whole Life or Ordinary Life)\nWhile term insurance is designed to provide protection for a specified time period, permanent insurance is designed to provide coverage for your entire lifetime. To keep the premium rate level, the premium at the younger ages exceeds the actual cost of protection. This extra premium builds a reserve (cash value) which helps pay for the policy in later years as the cost of protection rises above the premium. Whole life policies stretch the cost of insurance over a longer period of time in order to level out the otherwise increasing cost of insurance. Under some policies, premiums are required to be paid for a set number of years. Under other policies, premiums are paid throughout the policyholder's lifetime. The insurance company invests the excess premium dollars\nThis type of policy, which is sometimes called cash value life insurance, generates a savings element. Cash values are critical to a permanent life insurance policy. The size of the cash value build-up differs from company to company. Sometimes, there is no correlation between the size of the cash value and the premiums paid. It is the cash value of the policy that can be accessed while the policyholder is alive.\nThe Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table (CSO) is the current table used in calculating minimum nonforfeiture values and policy reserves for ordinary life insurance policies. This table provides the minimum cash values that must be guaranteed in your policy.\nThe policy's essential elements consist of the premium payable each year, the death benefits payable to the beneficiary and the cash surrender value the policyholder would receive if the policy is surrendered prior to death. You may make a loan against the cash value of the policy at a specified rate of interest or a variable rate of interest but such outstanding loans, if not repaid, will reduce the death benefit.\nIn 1984 a new federal tax law required that for permanent insurance to enjoy preferred tax treatment it must provide coverage up to at least age 95, limit the amount of premium that may be paid in relation to the face amount of coverage and establish a minimum ratio between cash value and face amount of insurance. Many permanent policies will contain provisions, which specify these tax requirements.\nThere are two basic categories of permanent insurance, traditional and interest-sensitive, each with a number of variations. In addition, each category is generally available in either fixed-dollar or variable form.\nTraditional Whole Life\nTraditional whole life policies are based upon long-term estimates of expense, interest and mortality. The premiums, death benefits and cash values are stated in the policy.\nThere are six basic variations of traditional permanent insurance:\n\nNon-Participating Whole Life: A non-participating whole life policy will give you a level premium and face amount during your entire life. The advantages of such a policy are its fixed costs and generally low out-of-pocket premium payments. The disadvantage is that it pays no dividends.\nParticipating Whole Life: A participating whole life policy pays dividends. The dividends represent the favorable experience of the company and result from excess investment earnings, favorable mortality and expense savings. Dividends can be paid in cash, used to reduce premiums, left to accumulate at interest or used to purchase paid-up additional insurance. Dividends are not guaranteed.\nIndeterminate Premium Whole Life: An indeterminate premium whole life policy is like a non-participating whole life plan of insurance except that it provides for adjustable premiums. The company will charge a \"current\" premium based on its current estimate of investment earnings, mortality, and expense costs. If these estimates change in later years, the company will adjust the premium accordingly but never above the maximum guaranteed premium stated in the policy.\nEconomatic Whole Life: An economatic whole life policy provides for a basic amount of participating whole life insurance with an additional supplemental coverage provided through the use of dividends. This additional insurance usually is a combination of decreasing term insurance and paid-up dividend additions. Eventually, the dividend additions should equal the original amount of supplemental coverage. However, because dividends may not be sufficient to purchase enough paid up additions at a future date, it is possible that at some future time there could be a substantial decrease in the amount of supplemental insurance coverage.\nLimited Payment Whole Life If you want to pay premiums for a limited time the limited payment whole life policy gives you lifetime protection but requires only a limited number of premium payments. Because the premiums are paid over a shorter span of time, the premium payments will be higher than under the whole life plan.\nSingle Premium Whole Life Single premium whole life is limited payment life where one large premium payment is made. The policy is fully paid up and no further premiums are required. Many such policies have substantial surrender charges if you want to cash in the policy during the first few years. Since a substantial payment is involved, it should be viewed as an investment-oriented product.\n\t\nInterest in single premium life insurance is primarily due to the tax-deferred treatment of the build-up of its cash values. Taxes will be incurred on the gain, however, when you surrender the policy. You may borrow on the cash value of the policy, but remember that you may incur a substantial tax bill when you surrender, even if you have borrowed out all the cash value.\n\n\n\nInterest Sensitive Whole Life\nWhile insurers guarantee stated benefits on traditional contracts far into the future based on long-term and overall company experience, they allocate investment earnings differently on interest sensitive whole life in order to better reflect current fluctuations in interest rates. The advantage is that improvements in interest rates will be reflected more quickly in interest sensitive insurance than in traditional; the disadvantage, of course, is that decreases in interest rates will also be felt more quickly in interest sensitive whole life.\nThere are four basic interest sensitive whole life policies:\nUniversal Life The universal life policy is actually more than interest sensitive as it is designed to reflect the insurer's current mortality and expense as well as interest earnings rather than historic rates. Universal life works by treating separately the three basic elements of the policy: premium, death benefit and cash value. The company credits your premiums to the cash value account. Periodically the company deducts from the cash value account its expenses and the cost of insurance protection, usually described as the mortality deduction charge. The balance of the cash value account accumulates at the interest credited. The company guarantees a minimum interest rate and a maximum mortality charge. Some universal life policies also specify a maximum basis for the expense charge. These guarantees are usually very conservative. Current assumptions are critical to interest sensitive products such as Universal Life. When interest rates are high, benefit projections (such as cash value) are also high. When interest rates are low, these projections are not as attractive.\nUniversal life is also the most flexible of all the various kinds of policies. Because it treats the elements of the policy separately, universal life allows you to change or skip premium payments or change the death benefit more easily than with any other policy.\nThe policy usually gives you an option to select one or two types of death benefits. Under one option your beneficiaries received only the face amount of the policy, under the other they receive both the face amount and the cash value account. If you want the maximum amount of death benefit now, the second option should be selected.\nYou generally pay a planned premium designed to keep the policy in force for life, and accumulate cash value, based upon the interest and expense and mortality charges you assume. It is important that these assumptions be realistic because if they are not, you may have to pay more to keep the policy from decreasing or lapsing. On the other hand, if your experience is better then the assumptions, than you may be able in the future to skip a premium, to pay less, or to have the plan paid up at an early date.\nYou do not have to pay the planned premium, but if you pay less, the benefit may be more like term insurance, which is only in force for a limited time and builds no cash value. On the other hand, if you pay more, and your assumptions are realistic, it is possible to pay up the policy at an early date.\nIf you surrender a universal life policy you may receive less than the cash value account because of surrender charges which can be of two types. A front-end type policy will deduct a percentage of the premium paid, while a back-end type policy will deduct a more substantial charge but only if the policy is surrendered before a specified period, generally 10 years but which could be as long as 20 years. A back-end type policy would be preferable if you intend to maintain coverage, and the charge decreases with each year you continue the policy. Remember that the interest rate and expense and mortality charges payables initially are not guaranteed for the life of the policy.\nAlthough this type of policy gives you maximum flexibility, you will need to actively manage the policy to maintain sufficient funding, especially because the insurance company can increase mortality and expense charges. You should remember that the mortality charges increase, as you become older.\nExcess Interest Whole Life If you are not interested in all of the flexible features of Universal Life, some insurers offer fixed premium versions called excess interest whole life. The key feature is that premium payments are required when due just like traditional whole life. If premiums are paid when due, the policy will not lapse.\nWith the premium level fixed, any additional or excess interest credited, or better life insurance experience, will improve the cash value of the policy. The premium level will probably be comparable to traditional whole life policies. Cash value may be applied to pay future premium payments. This type of product maximizes the deferred tax growth of your cash value.\nCurrent Assumption Whole Life Current assumption whole life is similar to a universal life policy but your company determines the amount of premium to be paid. The company sets the initial premium based upon its current estimate of future investment earnings and mortality experience and retains the contractual right to reevaluate its original estimates to increase or decrease your premium payments later. If premiums are increased, some policies let you decrease the face amount of coverage so that you can continue to pay the original premium. Current mortality and experience and investment earnings can be credited to the insurance policy either through the cash value account and/or the premium or dividend structure (depending on whether it is a stock or mutual company). Regardless, this type of policy has the following characteristics:\n\nThe premiums are subject to change based on the experience (mortality, expenses, investment) of the company. The policyowner does not exercise control over the changes.\nThe policyowner can use the cash value to make loans just as he/she would with any traditional ordinary life insurance policy.\nA minimum amount of cash value is guaranteed, just as with traditional ordinary life insurance.\nThe death benefit does not fluctuate.\n\nSingle Premium Whole Life \u00a0 There are a few single premium life products, which determine the premium using the current interest rate assumption. You may be asked to make additional premium payments where coverage could terminate because the interest rate dropped. Your starting interest rate is fixed only for a year or in some cases three to five years. The guaranteed rate provided for in the policy is much lower (e.g., 4%). Another feature that is sometimes emphasized is the \"no cost\" loan. Companies will set the loan interest rate to be charged on policy loans equal to the rate that is being credited to the policy.\nVariable Life\nMost types of both traditional and interest sensitive life policies can be purchased on either a fixed-dollar or variable basis. On a fixed-dollar basis, premium, face amount and cash values are specified in dollar amounts.\nOn the variable basis, face amount and cash value are specified in units, and the value of the units may increase or decrease depending upon the investment results. You can allocate your premiums among various investment pools (like stock, bond, money market, mutual funds and real estate pools) depending on the amount of risk you are willing to assume in the hope of a higher return.\nTraditional variable life provides a minimum guaranteed death benefit, but many universal variable life products do not, and should investment experience be bad, coverage will terminate if substantially higher premium payments are not made. Variable life is also made available on a single premium basis but if investment experience is poor additional premiums will be required.\nOther Coverages (Variations on the Basic Plans)\n>Credit Life Insurance\nAlthough you can obtain credit life insurance (term) as an individual, it is usually sold on a group basis to a creditor, such as a bank, finance company or a company selling high priced items on the installment plan. The policy generally pays the outstanding balance of the debt at the time of the borrower's death, subject to policy maximums. Debts covered in this way include: personal loans; loans to cover the purchase of appliances, motor vehicles, mobile homes, farm equipment; educational loans; bank credit and revolving check loans; mortgages loans; etc.\nWhen you borrow from an organization that has a group credit life policy, the organization may require you to purchase credit life insurance or it may simply offer the protection as an additional service. In either case you must receive a certificate of insurance describing the provisions of the group policy and any insurance charge. Generally the maximum amount of coverage is $220,000 for a mortgage loan and $55,000 for all other debts. Credit life insurance need not be purchased from the organization granting the loan.\nIf you are covered under a group credit life policy and you terminate coverage by prepaying or defaulting on the loan, or if the group policy itself is terminated, you may be entitled to a partial refund of the premium you paid so check your certificate. If life insurance is required by a creditor as a condition for making a loan, you may be able to assign an existing life insurance policy, if you have one. However, you may wish to buy group credit life insurance in spite of its higher cost because of its convenience and its availability, generally without detailed evidence of insurability.\nMonthly Debit Ordinary Insurance Debit insurance\n is insurance with premiums payable monthly which are meant to be collected by the agent at your home. In most cases, however, home collections are not made and premiums are mailed by you to the agent or to the company.\nThere are certain factors that tend to increase the costs of debit insurance more than regular life insurance plans:\n\nCertain expenses are the same no matter what the size of the policy, so that smaller policies issued as debit insurance will have higher premiums per $1,000 of insurance than larger size regular insurance policies.\nIn some companies, more debit policyholders allow their policies to lapse than is generally the case with policyholders of regular life insurance. Since early lapses are expensive to a company, the costs must be passed on to all debit policyholders.\nSince debit insurance is designed to include home collections, higher commissions and fees are paid on debit insurance than on regular insurance. In many cases these higher expenses are passed on to the policyholder.\nAs a general rule the combination of smaller amounts, higher lapse rates and higher commissions and fees on debit insurance tends to make it more expensive than comparable regular life insurance plans.\n\nWhere a company has different premiums for debit and regular insurance it may be possible for you to purchase a larger amount of regular insurance than debit at no extra cost. Therefore, if you are thinking of debit insurance, you should certainly investigate regular life insurance as a cost-saving alternative.\nModified Life Plan\nA modified life plan is similar to whole life except that you pay a lower premium for the first few years and a higher than regular whole life premium in later years. This plan is designed for those who cannot initially afford the regular whole life premium but who want the higher premium coverage and feel they will eventually be able to pay the higher premium.\nThe Family Policy\n The family policy is a combination plan that provides insurance protection under one contract to all members of your immediate family husband, wife and children. Usually family policies are sold in units (packages) of protection, such as $5,000 on the main wage earner, $1,500 on the spouse and $1,000 on each child.\nJoint Life and Survivor Insurance\nJoint Life and Survivor Insurance provides coverage for two or more persons with the death benefit payable at the death of the last of the insureds. Premiums are significantly lower under joint life and survivor insurance than for policies that insure only one person, since the probability of having to pay a death claim is lower.\nJoint Life Insurance\n Joint Life Insurance provides coverage for two or more persons with the death benefit payable at the first death. Premiums are significantly higher than for policies that insure one person, since the probability of having to pay a death claim is higher.\nEndowment Insurance Endowment insurance provides for the payment of the face amount to your beneficiary if death occurs within a specific period of time such as twenty years, or, if at the end of the specific period you are still alive, for the payment of the face amount to you. Due to recent tax law changes many endowment plans no longer qualify as life insurance for tax purposes and are generally not being offered by insurers.\n\nJuvenile insurance\nJuvenile insurance provides a minimum of protection and could provide coverage, which might not be available at a later date. Amounts provided under such coverage are generally limited based on the age of the child. The current limitations for minors under the age of 14.5 would be the greater of $50,000 or 50% of the amount of life insurance in force upon the life of the applicant. The limitations on a minor under the age of 4.5 would be the greater of $50,000 or 25% of the amount of life insurance in force upon the life of the applicant. Juvenile insurance may be sold with a payor benefit rider, which provides for waiving future premiums on the child's policy in the event of the death of the person who pays the premium.\nSenior Life Plans\nSenior life insurance, sometimes referred to as graded death benefit plans, provides eligible older applicants with minimal whole life coverage without a medical examination. Since such policies are issued with little or no underwriting they will provide only for a return of premium or minimum graded benefits if death occurs during a specified period which is generally the first two or three policy years. The permissible issue ages for this type of coverage range from ages 50 75. The maximum issue amount of coverage is $25,000. These policies are usually more expensive than a fully underwritten policy if the person qualifies as a standard risk.\nPre-need Insurance\nThis type of coverage is for a small face amount, typically purchased to pay the burial expenses of the insured. As previously mentioned within the discussion of monthly debit ordinary insurance, this coverage often carries a higher premium per $1,000 of coverage than larger size policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Questions and Complaints\nIf you are unable to find the answer to your questions here, check our FAQs.

At Aflac, we want to help simplify your search and guide you toward finding the life insurance policy that best fits your lifestyle.\nDepending on your coverage goals, your family size, your income, and financial aspirations, there may be one type of life insurance more suited for your specific needs than others. Let\u2019s dive deeper into how life insurance works, the types of policies available, and how you can choose life insurance that\u2019s best for you and your loved ones.\nHow Does Life Insurance Work?\nLife insurance is a policy that provides a death benefit payout to beneficiaries if you pass away while it\u2019s active. While there are various life insurance options, these plans tend to function similarly. Whether you have life insurance that lasts your entire life or just 20 years, you must pay regular premiums in order to receive your benefits.\nDepending on the type of life insurance policy, there may be other benefits available. Some life insurance plans offer benefits that can be used while the policyholder is still alive. These benefits may come in the form of a cash value component that can be used to help cover medical expenses or everyday costs of living.1\nTypes of Life Insurance Policies\nEach life insurance plan is distinct, so it\u2019s crucial to understand the different life insurance policies so you can find the best option for you and your family. Here are some common types of life insurance:\nWhole Life Insurance\nLike its name suggests, whole life insurance is a permanent coverage type that lasts your entire life. The benefit will be paid to your beneficiary whenever you pass. This may be a more expensive option upfront, but the benefits can be more secure in the long run.\nWhole life insurance may be the best type of coverage if you are looking for guaranteed support for your loved ones on any timeline. It may also be a wise move if you are hoping to factor in long-term financial planning.\nTerm Life Insurance\nTerm life insurance is a temporary type of policy that provides coverage for a set term or specific amount of time. At Aflac, we offer multiple term lengths in 10, 20, and 30-year increments. This plan may be a more affordable route. However, the policyholder must pass during the designated time frame of the plan for the beneficiary to receive benefits.\nThere are additional term life insurance considerations to make as well. In some cases, you may be able to extend the length of your term life insurance policy if you outlive the time frame (subject to limitations and exclusions). This depends on your history of payments and the established guidelines of the insurance carrier. Many customers typically compare the costs and values between term and whole life insurance.\nUniversal Life Insurance\nUniversal life insurance works a bit differently than both term and whole life insurance. It's a type of permanent policy that has an investment portion. This portion, otherwise known as the cash value, can grow throughout the life of the policyholder. The growth takes place in a tax-deferred account at a stable rate.\nThis type of life insurance plan also allows for greater flexibility, as you may be able to adjust the premium payments and benefit value over time.1\nFinal expense insurance\nFinal expense insurance is a type of permanent life policy that offers a smaller death benefit payout. Beneficiaries can use this payout to cover a funeral, burial costs, medical bills, and other end-of-life expenses after you pass away. Aflac offers final expense insurance with fixed and reasonable premiums.\nGroup Life Insurance\nAs a business owner, it\u2019s important to make sure your employees feel safe and seen. Group life insurance is a great type of policy if you are looking to provide benefits for your employees or members of an organization. Aflac gives you the opportunity to offer your hard workers term or whole group life insurance options.\nWhich Life Insurance Policy Type is Best for Me?\nThe right type of life insurance policy for you depends on important factors such as how much you are looking to spend on premium payments, how much coverage would you like to secure for your family, and the access to cash benefits. For instance, if you're starting a family and only need coverage until your children become adults, you may consider a term life policy.\n\n\n\n\nPeace of mind doesn't have to break the bank\nDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Help cover yourself and your family with coverage from Aflac.\n\nGet a Quote\n\n\n\n\nHow to Choose the Best Type of Life Insurance\nEven after learning the differences between each type of plan, it can be confusing to pick the life insurance policy that best meets your needs. Talking to an agent always helps, but there are also a few key factors that can help you narrow down your decision.\nChoose a Plan Type\nIf budgeting is your biggest concern, term life insurance may be the best choice. If you have many dependents, whole life insurance may be a better route. However, if financial planning and cash value are most important to you, universal life insurance may be a strong option. Lastly, if you are a business owner, group life insurance might be the best life insurance option.\nFigure Out How Much Insurance You Need\nAssessing how many dependents you have can help clarify how much life insurance coverage you need. You can reflect on what figure feels right and talk to an agent about how to work this into your plan. The coverage options vary depending on what\u2019s offered in each different type of life insurance plan.\nCompare Plan Features and Extra Benefits\nSome life insurance options have extra benefits that may make your plan worthwhile. For example, some insurance carriers offer long-term care riders that can be added to life insurance plans.  These types of riders allow policyholders to access a portion of the policy\u2019s death benefit every month to pay for long-term care costs.2\nWe recommend you determine which additional elements are non-negotiable for your needs. If cash value is a top priority for you, your life insurance options may start to slim down. Reading the fine print and understanding the benefits within each plan can help tip the scale too.\nCompare Quotes\nLastly, getting some numbers in front of you always helps paint a clearer picture. You can request a quote from Aflac and try our life insurance calculator to start planning for the future now.\nAflac Offers Various Types of Life Insurance\nAt Aflac, we offer whole and term life insurance policies that are flexible to help meet you and your family's needs. Our plans are portable, so you can take them with you if you move or change jobs. Now that you understand each type of life insurance, you can make an informed decision about your family's future and choose the life insurance coverage that is best for your loved ones.\nOther Types of Life Insurance\nHere are some other types of life insurance policies you may consider:\n\nVariable life insurance: This type of permanent life insurance has cash value that is tied to investment accounts. The cash value can rise and fall based on how those investments perform.\n\nCredit life insurance: Credit life insurance is a policy designed to help loved ones pay off large debts, such as a mortgage or car loan, if you pass away before you fully repay them. \n\nSimplified issue life insurance: This type of life insurance plan involves taking a health questionnaire instead of a medical exam to get approved. This can allow a potential policyholder to get coverage more quickly.\n\nTypes of Life Insurance Features\nLife insurance can be a complex financial product, so it\u2019s important to understand the features it offers:\nDeath Benefit\nThe death benefit is the primary feature of life insurance and is the lump sum payment made by the insurer to the designated beneficiary upon the death of the insured. The amount of coverage chosen by the policyholder is generally determined by their financial needs and the premiums they pay for the policy. \nPremium\nLife insurance policies come with premiums, which are the payments made to maintain coverage. Premiums can vary depending on factors like the type of policy, age and health of the policyholder, and the death benefit amount. \nCash Value\nThe cash value is a feature that typically comes with permanent life insurance policies. This savings or investment component allows the policyholder to accumulate funds over time. These funds can then be accessed through loans or withdrawals.\nBeneficiaries\nLife insurance policyholders name one or more individuals as their beneficiaries, who will receive the death benefit upon the insured\u2019s passing. Examples of beneficiaries include a partner, children, other family members, charities, and other organizations.\nRiders\nIn some cases, you can add riders to a life insurance policy to increase the death benefit or provide additional coverage. For example, an accidental death benefit rider provides additional coverage if you pass away due to a covered accident.\nHow to Get a Life Insurance Policy\nTake these steps to get the right life insurance policy for your needs:\n\nApply and take the medical exam: Once you have found a policy that meets your needs, you can fill out an application and take a medical exam. This is to ensure that the insurance company understands any pre-existing conditions or risks associated with your lifestyle.\n\nReceive coverage: After completing all the necessary paperwork, you can get the type of life insurance policy you need. The policy will include a death benefit amount, premiums, and other features depending on your individual requirements.\n\nAdjust your life insurance policy as needed: Once the life insurance policy is in place, it's important to review it periodically to ensure that it meets your needs and remains up to date with any changes in your lifestyle or health. For instance, if you're starting a family, you may want to increase the death benefit amount. \n\n\n\n\nStill have questions?\nExplore your life insurance options.\n\nGet a Quote\n\n\n \n\n\nDisclaimer             \n\n\n1 Investopedia.

Call us:(888) 482-7342Different types of life insuranceDiscover your options and learn how to choose the best policy for your coverage needs.There are many types of life insurance policies that can help protect your family, and they all fall into two main categories: term and permanent.Get an instant Term Life quoteGo NowWith term life insurance policies, you get coverage for a defined length of time (say, ten years). If you die during that time, money is paid to your beneficiaries \u2013 but when the term is over, you must get new coverage or go without.Permanent life insurance (i.e., whole life and universal life) provides life-long death benefit coverage and also includes a \u201ccash value\u201d component that can help with many objectives, like helping to build your retirement nest egg while providing protection for life and other financial benefits along the way.1,2 To help you decide which kind of protection will work best for you, here are some things you should know:The basic features of a life insurance policyThe different kinds of policies you can buy including:Term life insuranceWhole life insuranceUniversal life insuranceFinal expense insuranceSimplified issue and guaranteed issue life insuranceGroup life insuranceHow to choose the right policy for youWhat are the basic features of a life insurance policy?At its core, a life insurance policy is a promise to provide financial protection to your loved ones if you\u2019re not there. The way a policy carries out that promise is defined by a few key features:The death benefit: The amount of money the insurance company will pay when the insured person dies. Typically, this benefit is income-tax-free.3 The life insurance company is responsible for assessing risks, processing claims, and determining premiums.The beneficiaries: The person or people who get the death benefit. It can all go to a single person (e.g., a surviving spouse), or divided by percentage among a few people (e.g., a spouse could get 50%, and two adult children could each get 25%). And by the way, a beneficiary doesn\u2019t have to be a blood relative or even a person \u2013 if you choose, you can leave all or part of your death benefit to an entity, such as a charitable cause.The policy length or term: The time period that the insurer agrees to pay a death benefit. A term policy is defined as a specific number of years, such as 10, 20, or 30. A permanent policy lasts for the life of the insured, for whole life as long as premiums are paid, and for universal life as long as the policy is funded properly to pay monthly expenses.The premium - The monthly or yearly payments needed to keep the policy in effect.The cash value - The policy\u2019s cash value component can build over time and can be cashed out or borrowed against.4,5 A term policy has no cash value.The different types of life insurance policies and their key featuresTerm life insuranceA term life policy is exactly what the name implies: Coverage for a specific term or length of time, typically between 10 and 30 years. It is sometimes called \u201cpure life insurance\u201d because, unlike whole life insurance, the policy has no cash value. It\u2019s designed solely to give your beneficiaries a payout if you die during the term.When you decide to buy life insurance, you can choose from various methods, such as contacting a local agent or financial professional, exploring online marketplaces, or reaching out directly to insurance companies.Most individual term policies have level premiums, so you pay the same amount every month. When the term expires, there\u2019s no more coverage \u2013 you either have to go without or get a new policy, which will likely come at a higher cost: the older you are, the more expensive it is to get a policy. However, many providers \u2013 including Guardian \u2013 will allow you to convert a term policy to permanent life insurance for part or all of the coverage period. If you receive term life insurance through an employer, rates are typically issued \u201con attained age,\u201d which means the rates will increase over time.This calculator can help you determine the cost of term life insurance at the coverage level you want. How many years will your family need financial protection? For most people, until the kids are grown up, the house is paid off, and there\u2019s some money that can serve as protection for the surviving spouse.Whole life insuranceA whole life policy is the simplest form of permanent life insurance, providing coverage that lasts your entire life. Like other permanent policies, it includes a cash value component: A portion of your premium dollars are placed into a cash value account, and this sum grows over time on a tax-deferred basis, so you don\u2019t pay taxes on the gains.3Compared to other forms of permanent coverage, a whole life policy has three defining characteristics:The level premium remains the same for lifeThe death benefit is guaranteed as long as the guaranteed premiums are paid.6The policy includes guaranteed cash values that grow at a guaranteed rateCash value provides several significant benefits you can use while you\u2019re still alive. It takes a few years to grow into a useful amount, but once that happens, you can borrow money against it, use it to help pay your premiums, or even surrender it for cash to live on in retirement.7When you get a whole life policy from a mutual company, such as Guardian, your cash value can earn annual dividends.8 You get a portion of the insurer\u2019s profits, which can be used to increase the value of your policy and provide other benefits. While not guaranteed, Guardian has paid participating whole life policyholders a dividend every year since 1868.Whole Life vs. Term Life InsuranceKey differences between term and whole life insurance include:The policy length: A whole life policy lasts your entire life, while a term policy only provides coverage for a limited number of years. Once the term expires, your beneficiaries are no longer entitled to a death benefit.The cash value: A term policy has no value once it expires. A whole life policy is a life-long asset that can be accessed to help meet financial goals up to and after retirement.The premium: For a given death benefit \u2014 e.g., $100,000 \u2014 premiums will be higher for whole life, along with the certainty that your beneficiaries will eventually be paid death benefits.Universal life insuranceA universal life policy is another form of permanent insurance that offers the cash value and lifetime coverage benefits of whole life. But there\u2019s a fundamental difference compared to whole life : the premiums are flexible.With a universal policy, you can raise or lower the amount you pay into the policy as you see fit, within the limits of the policy.9 Paying in less could eventually result in the need to pay in higher amounts in later years to keep your coverage. This policy can adjust to your life circumstances while providing cash value growth. Having another child, moving on to a different job, or taking out a loan to buy a business \u2014 might be instances where a combination of protection and flexibility becomes important.Final expense insuranceFinal expense insurance is a form of life insurance intended only to cover end-of-life expenses such as funeral and burial costs. The coverage is permanent in the sense that if you keep paying premiums, the policy will remain in effect, but there is no cash value component to these policies. Older people often buy final expense coverage without dependent children because it helps protect loved ones who might otherwise have to cover these costs out-of-pocket. While the premiums for these tend to be modest, the death benefit is also very limited \u2013 it\u2019s not meant to provide years of financial support to your beneficiaries. Younger, healthier people who want to build cash value or a significant death benefit for their families may be able to find greater value in a whole life, universal life, or term life policy.Simplified issue and guaranteed issue insuranceMost life insurance policies are underwritten: they require a medical exam as part of the application process so that the provider can assess your risk to insure. Simplified issue and guaranteed issue policies don\u2019t require a medical exam. These policies are primarily designed for older applicants or those with serious health problems who may not qualify for policies that require a medical exam.Some term policies and most final expense policies are either simplified issue or guaranteed issue. When applying for a simplified issue policy, you\u2019ll be asked to fill out a health questionnaire in place of an exam. With a guaranteed issue policy, you won\u2019t be asked to undergo an exam or complete a questionnaire \u2013 no medical information is needed to qualify for approval. These policies typically offer lower levels of coverage compared to other types, and premiums tend to be higher because the insurance company has to assume that there\u2019s a high risk to providing coverage.Group life insuranceThis is life insurance that you buy as part of a group \u2013 typically through work as part of your employee benefits package, or via a member organization. Most group life insurance is term, but some companies also offer permanent coverage as a voluntary (employee-paid) benefit.Until recently, individual policies \u2013 bought through agents or directly from insurance companies \u2013 were the most common way to get life insurance. Now, more Americans are covered by employment-based group policies. These plans offer relatively affordable premiums because the company or organization is effectively \u201cbuying in bulk.\u201d Some employers even provide workers with term coverage equal to 1x their salary at no cost to the employee. Group policies may also be simplified issue, at least for lower coverage amounts, which helps employees with health issues obtain coverage. On the other hand, coverage amounts can be limited.Group life may not provide the comprehensive coverage you want, but it can be an easy, affordable way to start or supplement your life insurance protection. If available, find out if the policy is portable: that means that if you leave your job, you can take your coverage with you.Got a minute?

After all, one of the main benefits of having life insurance is that it helps provide a level of certainty in a world that is anything but. Financial strength ratings are an objective way to gain assurance that the company will be there for your family, many years down the road.10Now that you know basics, it\u2019s time to talk things over with someone who can help you decide exactly which type of life insurance is right for you. As you\u2019d expect, that will depend on your age, financial situation, family status, and a host of other factors. A broker or financial professional can help you determine which type of policy you should consider, how it can be tailored to your needs, and which alternatives are available if a term, whole life, or universal life insurance doesn\u2019t work for you.
