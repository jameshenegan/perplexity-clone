If you do decide to shop for life insurance, here are some things to consider. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u25ba \n\n\nHow much life insurance do you need?\nLife insurance is there to help your loved ones with financial needs if you aren\u2019t there anymore. Consider your mortgage and other debts, how much income would need to be replaced, money to cover a funeral, and college for the kids. Add those up, and you'll have a good idea of how much insurance you\u2019ll need.\n\n\nTerm or permanent?\nThere are two main categories of life insurance:\nTerm life insurance is the simplest and least expensive option. It covers you for a set period of time. You might consider term life insurance when you have a family that depends on your financial support or while you have a mortgage. For example, you may want a term life policy that lasts until your children are out of school.\nPermanent life insurance provides coverage for your entire life as long as you keep up the payments. Because of the length of coverage, it costs more than term life insurance. These policies may have features that offer a cash value that can be used to invest or pay some of the premiums later in life. Permanent life policies are complicated so it\u2019s best to talk to a financial planner when deciding if one is right for you. If you do buy a permanent life policy, make sure to check with your agent each year to see how the policy is doing and if you need to adjust your payments.\n\n\nHow much will it cost?\nInsurance companies consider things like your age, health, job, and tobacco and alcohol use when setting prices. It will cost more to purchase life insurance as you get older and if you have health problems. Some companies may require a medical exam before selling you life insurance.\n\n\nWho will benefit?\nYou can leave money to a spouse, children, other family member, or friend. This is known as the policy\u2019s beneficiary. You can also name an institution as your beneficiary, such as a business or charity. And you can choose more than one beneficiary and specify how the money will be divided.\n\n\nResources\n\nLife insurance guide\nCan I sell my life insurance policy?\nWhat you should know about your universal life insurance policy (video)\nHow to shop for life insurance (video)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?

insurance\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Link Copied\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nReasons to buy insurance are different for everyone. But the decision to purchase insurance is, at its core, all about providing financial security for yourself and the ones you care about. Learn why life insurance is important, and who needs it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is life insurance important?\nBuying\u00a0life insurance\u00a0protects your spouse and children from the potentially devastating financial losses that could result if something happened to you. It provides financial security, helps to pay off debts, helps to pay living expenses, and helps to pay any medical or final expenses.\n\u00a0\nLife insurance provides cash when you need it most.\n\nYour life insurance policy can deliver a specified sum of money when you need it. Upon your death, your family will receive your policy payout immediately. And that death benefit is generally not subject to federal income taxes. For example, a $500,000 policy provides $500,000 in death benefit proceeds directly to your beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps in the insurance buying process:\n\nDetermine your goals, determine how much insurance you need to meet your goals over time, and determine what you can afford to pay.\n\nLearn what types of insurance can help you meet your needs.\n\nAfter considering initial premium payments, any possible increases in premiums over time, any additional death benefits,1\u00a0and any living benefits2\u00a0that can be utilized before you die, choose the type of insurance policy (or combination of types) that best meets your needs.\n\n\nRemember, working with a financial professional can help make this whole process easier. A financial professional can help explain the differences between types of policies, help you calculate the amount you need, and present potential options that may best suit your needs.\n\u00a0\nWhy get life insurance?\nLife insurance can give you lasting peace of mind in terms of the assurance that you have provided a legacy. That\u2019s because the right coverage can offer a valuable combination of benefits, many guaranteed by the claims-paying ability of New York Life\u2014so that you and your loved ones know exactly what you\u2019re getting.3\u00a0Of course, you have to make a long-term commitment to paying premiums and keeping the policy in force.\u00a0 Some of the most common reasons for buying life insurance include:\u00a0\n1. Guaranteed protection\nIf you have a family, a business, or others who depend on you, the life insurance benefit of a whole life policy acts as a financial safety net. When you die, your beneficiaries will receive a lump-sum payment that is guaranteed to be paid in full (provided all premiums are paid and there are no outstanding loans). It\u2019s essential protection that you can count on to be there for your loved ones when needed.\n2. Income replacement\nImagine what would happen to your family if the income you provide suddenly disappeared. With whole life insurance, you can help make sure that your loved ones have the money they need to help:\n\nPay the mortgage\nAfford childcare, health care, or other services\u00a0\nCover tuition or other college expenses\u00a0\n\nEliminate household debt\n\nPreserve a family business\n\n3.\u00a0Tax-free benefit\nYour beneficiaries will be able to enjoy every penny you leave them. That\u2019s because the benefit of a life insurance policy is generally passed along federal income tax free.\n4. Guaranteed cash value growth\nAs you pay your premiums, your Whole Life policy builds cash value that is guaranteed to grow\u2014tax deferred\u2014and can help meet a variety of financial goals:\u00a0\n\nSupplement retirement income\u00a0\nFund a child or grandchild\u2019s education\u00a0\nPay off a mortgage\u00a0\nProtect existing assets\u00a0\nEstablish an emergency fund\u00a0\n\n5. Dividend potential\nOne of the benefits of purchasing whole life insurance from New York Life is that you will be eligible to receive dividends.4\u00a0Although they are not guaranteed, when dividends are awarded, you can take them in cash, use them to offset your premiums, or use them to buy paid-up additional insurance that increases your coverage and cash value, use them to offset your premiums, or take them in cash.\n6. Optional riders\nThere are several ways to tailor a whole life policy to meet your individual needs. For an additional cost, you can use riders to purchase additional protection without further underwriting, to pay your premiums if you become disabled, to use some of your face amount to pay for chronic illnesses, or to purchase coverage for your children. Your agent can help you decide if any of these riders are right for you.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Buying life insurance for the first time? \n\n\n\n\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Should I get life insurance in my 20s? \n\n\n\n\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Life Insurance Costs and Pricing Explained \n\n\n\n\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about life insurance?\nA New York Life financial professional can help determine what\u2019s right for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n                Life insurance does more than just protect your family.\n            \n\nLearn how life insurance can help you achieve your financial goals for you and your family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Please enter valid email.\n                        \n\n                            Please try again later.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1The life insurance death benefit is the amount that is paid when the policy is in effect and the insured dies. The insured is the person whose life is covered under the policy. Accessing the cash value of a Whole Life policy for special expenditures will reduce the available cash surrender value and the death benefit.\n2A living benefit is any benefit the policy owner can access while the insured is still living. Not all life insurance policies are designed to offer living benefits.\n3All guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the issuer\n4While dividends are not guaranteed, eligible policy owners have received them for more than 160 years. Some policies are participating but are not expected to receive dividends.\nOregon Policy Form Numbers for New York Life Whole Life:\u00a0New York Life Insurance Company is the issuer of New York Life Whole Life.

question but I feel like I'm getting old now and have gotten so many letters promoting life insurance I'm starting to wonder if they're worthwhile.\n  \n    In complete transparency I know very little about it and have always thought it might just be a waste of money, but thinking now maybe it wouldn't be an industry if it was.\n  \n    Also when I was younger I thought the same of car insurance until I needed my policy to help during a crash at which point I was very glad I had it.\n  \n    I get life insurance is a little different since I'll be dead if the policy is used but if anyone is
