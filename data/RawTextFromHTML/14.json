Here, we'll answer the most common questions about life insurance so you're confident in deciding what's best for you.Get my priceWhat is life insurance?Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and policyholder. In exchange for a premium, the life insurance company agrees to pay a sum of money to one or more named beneficiaries upon the death of the policyholder. The purpose of life insurance is to help provide financial security to your loved ones upon your death. However, some life policies also offer living benefits. This means they can pay a part of the policy's death benefit while you're still alive. These policies can be a financial resource you can use if you're diagnosed with a covered illness that's considered chronic, critical, or terminal. \nWhat types of life insurance are there?Life insurance policies fall into 2 categories: term and permanent.Term life insuranceA term life insurance policy gives you coverage for a set number of years. You can select the term period you want, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If you die during the coverage period and have a covered claim, your policy will pay benefits to your named beneficiaries. If you live past the selected period of time, the policy will simply expire.\nPermanent life insuranceUnlike term life insurance that expires after a set number of years, a permanent life insurance policy doesn't expire and will cover you for your whole life. Permanent life insurance policies remain active until you die, unless you stop paying your premiums or surrender the policy.The 3 most common types of permanent life insurance policies are whole, universal, and variable.\nWhole life insuranceUnlike term life, whole life insurance doesn't have an expiration date. In addition, a portion of the premiums you pay into your whole life policy builds cash value over time.Some insurance companies offer small whole life policies, often referred to as burial insurance. These policies generally come with a death benefit that typically ranges from $5,000 to $25,000 and are often purchased by people who want to leave their beneficiaries with just enough money to cover their final expenses, such as funeral and burial costs.\nUniversal life insuranceLike whole life, a universal life insurance policy provides a lifetime of coverage and can build cash value over time. However, this type of policy also gives flexibility when it comes to making payments. For example, if you have enough cash value in your policy, you can use that money to skip a premium payment.\nVariable life insuranceVariable life is another type of permanent life insurance that can build cash value. However, variable life differs from universal and whole life in that it has the potential to increase the value of certain subaccounts within the policy for even greater growth potential over time. \nWhat type of policy should I choose \u2013 whole or term life insurance?Whether you should pick term or whole life insurance depends on things like your needs and budget.Term life insurance is often a more affordable for people who need coverage but have a limited budget. For people willing to pay more and want a lifetime of coverage and access to cash value, a permanent policy may be a better option.Before buying a term or permanent life insurance policy, it's important to considerHow much coverage you needYour budget and how much you can pay each monthWhat types of policy riders, if any, are available and the costsThe coverage and cost differences between policy types (quote comparisons)\nWhat does a life insurance policy cost?The cost of a life insurance policy depends on things likeThe type of policy Your age and healthThe amount of coverage you wantYour occupationUnfortunately, many people think life insurance is too expensive. The truth is, more than half of Americans overestimate the cost of life insurance by as much as 3 times!1This misperception can put families needlessly at risk of financial hardship. Today, the cost of an average term life insurance for a healthy 30-year-old is estimated to be around $160 per year \u2013 just $13 a month.1While there are a lot of variables when it comes to how much you'll pay for life insurance (policy type, benefit amount, your occupation, etc.), a policy is likely to be a lot less expensive the younger and healthier you are at the time you buy it.\nHow do I choose a beneficiary?The purpose of a life insurance policy is to provide financial support to an individual, organization, or entity after you die. As the policyholder and named insured, you can name any person, organization, or entity to be the beneficiary of your life insurance policy.However, the beneficiaries you pick must have what the insurance industry calls \u201can insurable interest\u201d in your life. Simply put, the beneficiary list on your policy must have more to lose than gain upon your deathCommon choices for life insurance beneficiaries includeSpouseChild(ren)Domestic partnerFriendEstate or trustCharitable organizationLegal entity, such as a family business\nHow and when do my beneficiaries get paid?Upon your death, your beneficiaries must file a claim with the life insurance company as benefits aren't automatically paid. In most states, a death claim can be filed online, by contacting the agent, or by calling the life insurance company directly.While the rules can differ by state, to receive any benefits, the insurance company will typically require beneficiaries toVerify the death of the policyholder (in most states, this means providing the life insurance company with a certified copy of the deceased death certificate and their social security number).Verify their identity and relationship to the insured. This can include a copy of the beneficiary's driver's license and/or Social Security number.Provide a copy of the life insurance policy or the policy number. There's no time limit for a beneficiary to file a death claim. However, the sooner a claim is filed, and the insurance company receives the required paperwork, the sooner the benefit can be paid.In general, once a valid claim has been filed, payment is typically made within 30 days, although it can sometimes take up to 60 days.2 If there are multiple beneficiaries, each person must file their own claim.Beneficiaries can typically receive their money by check or electronic transfer. In addition, they can also select how much money to receive. For example, they can receive all the money as a lump sum, by way of an installment or annuity plan, or a retained asset account (where the insurance company acts as the bank and allows a beneficiary to write checks against the balance).3\nOverwhelmed?

An illustration is a presentation or depiction provided to prospective or new policy owners that shows how the policy should perform under specific circumstances set out in the illustration. While the components of illustrations may differ depending on the type and complexity of the policy, there are similarities across policy forms. Items common to all life insurance policy illustrations include the benefits entitled to a policyholder, the premiums required to maintain the benefit, the expenses related to policy issue and maintenance, and the benefit and premium periods.\nOverview:\u00a0Life insurance illustrations are subject to the\u00a0Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation\u00a0(#582). The purpose of Model #582 is to \u201cprovide rules for life insurance policy illustrations that will protect consumers and foster consumer education.\u201d It is applicable to all group and individual life insurance policies and certificates with illustrated death benefits exceeding $10,000. Exceptions to this include variable life insurance, credit life insurance contracts, and\u00a0annuities.\nThe model allows the insurer to choose whether a policy form will be marketed with an illustration. For policy forms actively marketed prior to the effective date of the regulation, the insurer is required to identify the forms that will use an illustration in the sales process. Policy forms issued after the effective date of the regulation must include a similar identification when filing. For any policy form identified as one not to be marketed with an illustration, the insurer is prohibited from providing an illustration for any policy using that form prior to the first policy anniversary.\nModel #582 defines three types of illustrations: 1) a basic illustration; 2) a supplemental illustration; and 3) an in-force illustration. The basic illustration is used in the marketing of the policy and shows both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements of the policy. Among the guaranteed elements are policy benefits, premiums, values, credits, and charges that are guaranteed and determined at issue. Each of these elements has a non-guaranteed counterpart in the basic illustration that is not guaranteed or determined at issue. Using a\u00a0universal life\u00a0policy basic illustration as an example, the non-guaranteed elements include current death benefits, current fund accumulation, and the cash value and premiums related to the current benefits. These values are subject to the minimum values provided by the policy guarantees, and they cannot provide values more favorable than the illustrated values based on the company\u2019s actual recent historical experience.\nIn addition to the basic illustration, the company may provide a supplemental illustration that depicts only the non-guaranteed elements permitted in the basic illustration. The format of the supplemental illustration may differ from the basic illustration, but it is still subject to the requirements for non-guaranteed elements defined for the basic illustration. The supplemental illustration must refer the policy owner to the basic illustration for guaranteed elements and other important information.\nAfter the first policy anniversary, the company may choose to provide, or the policy owner may request, periodic updates on the policy\u2019s performance. These updates are provided in the form of in-force illustrations. All aspects of the in-force illustration are\u00a0like\u00a0the basic illustration, including listing the age of the insured as the issue age plus the number of years the policy has been in force.\nModel #582 contains specific requirements concerning the inclusion of the basic illustration as part of the life insurance policy delivery process. The requirements state that if marketing the policy includes an illustration and the policy is applied for as illustrated, the authorized company representative must submit the illustration, signed by that representative and the applicant, to the insurer at the time of policy application. If an illustration is not used in the sale of the policy, both the applicant and the authorized company representative must sign a form provided by the insurer acknowledging that no illustration was used. If an illustration is presented prior to application and is later revised before the policy is issued, the new illustration must be labeled \u201cRevised Illustration.\u201d In all cases where an illustration is required, the policy applied for or issued must have an illustration accurately representing the policy and appropriately signed by the applicant or policy owner and the authorized company representative. The illustration must be provided prior to or simultaneously with the policy delivery.\nTo provide guidance to policies whose benefits are tied to an external index or indices, the NAIC adopted\u00a0Actuarial Guideline XLIX\u2014The Application of the Life Illustrations Model Regulation to Policies with Index-Based Interest\u00a0(AG 49) on Aug. 16, 2015. AG 49 was developed to bring uniformity to the illustrations of policies tied to an external index or indices by providing a reasonable cap on the illustrated credited rate. Uniformity across illustrations helps clients to compare the policies of different companies more easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\n\nStatus:\u00a0The NAIC encourages states to adopt\u00a0model laws\u00a0and regulations designed to inform and protect insurance consumers. Model #582 provides rules for life insurance policy illustrations that will protect consumers and foster consumer education. Life insurance and annuities are regulated by state insurance commissioners.
