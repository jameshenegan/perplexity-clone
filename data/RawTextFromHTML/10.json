The beneficiaries can be one or more individuals or even an organization.\nIn most cases, policies are purchased by the person whose life is insured. However, life insurance policies can be taken out by spouses or anyone who is able to prove they have an insurable interest in the person. If you buy insurance on someone else\u2019s life (a spouse, for example), the policy pays when that person dies.\nWhich type of policy should I choose?\nThere are many different types of life insurance policies, you should choose a policy with features that fit your individual needs. Based on their unique characteristics, it is possible to identify several distinct types of life insurance coverages. However, they fall into two classes of life insurance products: term and cash value policies.\nWhat is term life insurance? Term life insurance\u00a0is a policy that is purchased for a period of time (a term). The policy pays money to the named beneficiaries if the insured dies during the term. Term life insurance is intended to provide lower-cost coverage for a specific period, like a ten year or 20-year period.\u00a0\nTerm life policies may include a provision that allows coverage to continue (renew) at the end of the term, even if your health status has changed. However, those premiums may be higher than the original policy.\u00a0\u00a0Ask what the premiums will be before you renew. Also, ask if you lose the right to renew at a certain age. If the policy is non-renewable you will need to apply for coverage at the end of the term.\u00a0\nWhat is a\u00a0cash value life insurance policy?\u00a0A cash value life insurance policy is different because you can keep it for as long as you need it. These policies also have savings or investment features, which make it possible for policy owners to get money from the policy while they\u2019re still alive. Whole life, universal life, and variable life are types of cash value policies.\nEveryone\u2019s financial situation is different. First, decide if life insurance is even necessary. If it is, here are some questions to ask.\nWhat should I ask myself when considering a life insurance policy?\n\nHow much of the family income do I provide?\nWill these financial obligations change over time?\nKnowing that the risk of death increases each year, in how many years do you anticipate the need for death\u00a0benefits?\u00a0\n\nWhat should I ask my insurance agent?\n\nDo I pay the premiums on a set schedule?\nDoes the policy have a cash value?\nDo the policy values change from year to year?\nWhat part of the premium or policy value isn\u2019t guaranteed?\nAre there guaranteed minimums on my policy?\n\nWhat else should I consider?\nIf you already have life insurance, it\u2019s important to compare your current policy with any new policy you might consider. Also, keep in mind that any changes in your health may affect your ability to get a new policy or the premium that you\u2019ll pay. Don\u2019t cancel a current policy until you get a new one.\nBefore you buy a life insurance policy, be sure you can afford the premium. The premiums for many life insurance policies are sensitive to changes in the company\u2019s investment earnings, claim costs, and other expenses.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to ask what the highest premium might be to keep your coverage.\nDoes your policy have a cash value? In some cash value policies, the values are low in the early years but build later.\u00a0\u00a0In other policies, the values build up gradually over time. Ask your insurance agent, financial advisor, or insurance company representative for an illustration showing future values and benefits.\u00a0\u00a0Most term policies have no cash value.\u00a0\nKEY POINTS TO REMEMBER\u00a0\n1. Make sure you understand how your policy works and that you clearly understand the payouts.\n2. It is important to fill out the application honestly.\u00a0Insurance companies will check your answers, so review the application before you sign. As with any insurance product, any false statements on the application could reduce or cancel your coverage.\n3. Read your policy carefully to make sure your personal information is correct and that you included the Social Security or tax ID number of all beneficiaries.\n4. Insurance companies won\u2019t pay a minor. Instead, consider leaving the money to an estate or trust.\nGET MORE INFORMATION: For more in-depth information on life insurance get a copy of the NAIC Life Insurance Buyers Guide.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\nAs part of our state-based system of insurance regulation in the United States, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides expertise, data, and analysis for insurance commissioners to effectively regulate the industry and protect consumers. The U.S. standard-setting organization is governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate regulatory oversight. NAIC staff supports these efforts and represents the collective views of state regulators domestically and internationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1991-2024 National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\nAll rights reserved.\nStop.Call.Confirm is a registered service mark\u00a0of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nConnect\nWorkplace\nWeb CMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\n\nMyNAIC\niSite+\nFinancial Statement Filing\nAutomated Valuation Service\nAccount Manager\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\nResource Center\nNewsroom\nPublications\nMeetings and Events\nEducation and Training\nGlossary of Insurance Terms\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\nContact\nHelp\nCareers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here are some guidelines that can help you narrow down your best life insurance options.\n\u00a0\nConsider term life insurance if...\n\nYou need life insurance for a specific period of time. Term life insurance enables you to match the length of the term policy to the length of the need. For example, if you have young children and want to ensure that there will be funds to pay for their college education, you might buy 20-year term life insurance. Or if you want the insurance to repay a debt that will be paid off in a specified time period, buy a term policy for that period.\nYou need a large amount of life insurance, but have a limited budget. In general, this type of insurance pays only if you die during the term of the policy, so the rate per thousand of death benefit is lower than for permanent forms of life insurance. If you are still alive at the end of the term, coverage stops unless the policy is renewed or a new one bought. Unlike permanent insurance, you will not typically build equity in the form of cash savings.\n\nIf you think your financial needs may change, you may also want to look into \u201cconvertible\u201d term policies. These allow you to convert to permanent insurance without a medical examination in exchange for higher premiums.\nKeep in mind that premiums are lowest when you are young and increase upon renewal as you age. Some term insurance policies can be renewed when the policy ends, but the premium will generally increase. Some policies require a medical examination at renewal to qualify for the lowest rates.\n\u00a0\nConsider permanent life insurance if...\n\nYou need life insurance for as long as you live. A permanent policy pays a death benefit whether you die tomorrow or live to be over 100.\nYou want to accumulate a savings element that will grow on a tax-deferred basis and could be a source of borrowed funds for a variety of purposes. The savings element can be used to pay premiums to keep the life insurance in force if you can\u2019t pay them otherwise, or it can be used for any other purpose you choose. You can borrow these funds even if your credit is shaky. The death benefit is collateral for the loan, and if you die before it\u2019s repaid, the insurance company collects what is due the company before determining what\u2019s goes to your beneficiary.\n\nKeep in mind that premiums for permanent policies are generally higher than for term insurance. However, the premium in a permanent policy remains the same no matter how old you are, while term can go up substantially every time you renew it.\nThere are a number of different types of permanent insurance policies, such as whole (ordinary) life, universal life, variable life, and variable/universal life. For more details, see our articles on the specific types of policies.\n\u00a0\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n\n\nLife Insurance\nWhat are the different types of permanent life insurance policies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain\nInsurance: The Basics\nResearch + Data\nResource Center\n\n\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nConceptos B\u00e1sicos de Seguros\n\n\nBlogs\nResilience Accelerator\nThe Triple-I Blog\n\n\n\n\nMembership\nLearn More About Membership\nRegister for a Member Account\n\n\nAmplify\nLearn More About Amplify\n\n\n\n\nMore\nAbout the I.I.I.\nAdvertising Opportunities\nIndustry Directory\nPermissions\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nCopyright Policy\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024, Insurance Information Institute, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n"

Term life covers you for a limited period, while permanent can stay in place for the rest of your life. However, the options don\u2019t stop there. Many other types of permanent life insurance cater to different needs and preferences. You can opt for whole life, universal life, variable life, and more.\n\n\n With so many options, it can be hard to know which life insurance policy or life insurance company is best for your situation. To help, here\u2019s a breakdown of the main types, how they work, and when each is generally a good fit.\u00a0\n\n\nKey Takeaways\nTerm life insurance offers coverage for a set number of years.Permanent life insurance can cover you for the rest of your life.Permanent life insurance comes in various forms including whole life, universal life, and variable life.\u00a0The best fit will depend on factors like your budget, age, health, preferences, and the level of risk you are willing to tolerate.\u00a0\n  Main Types of Life Insurance  \n Interested in life insurance but not sure where to start? Here are the five main types to know.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Insurance Types Chart Overview\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Term\n\u00a0Premiums\n\u00a0Death Benefit\nCash Value Component\n\u00a0Cash Value Growth\n\n\nTerm Life\nLimited, often 10, 15, 20, or 30 years\n\u00a0Fixed\nFixed\nNo\nNA\n\n\nWhole Life\nEntire life\nFixed\nFixed\nYes\nFixed\n\n\nUniversal Life\nEntire life\nFlexible\nFlexible\nYes\nBased on market interest rates\n\n\nVariable Universal Life\nEntire life\nFlexible\nFlexible\nYes\nInvested in subaccounts chosen by account holder\n\n\nFinal Expense/Burial\nEntire life\nFixed\nFixed\nFixed\nFixed\n\n\n\n\n\n  Term Life Insurance  \n Term life insurance policies offer coverage that is limited to a set period\u2014often 10, 20, or 30 years. You select a term and coverage amount and pay a monthly premium to keep coverage. If you pass away during the term in a way that doesn\u2019t violate the contract, your beneficiary receives the plan\u2019s death benefit. If you outlive the term, your coverage will end unless you opt for a renewal.\n\n\n Features\n\n\n Coverage for a set number of yearsPays death benefit to the beneficiary if you die during the termMay have a renewal option\n\n\n Pros\n\n\n Affordable premiumsPremiums do not increase during the termInsurers may allow renewals\n\n\n Cons\n\n\n Doesn\u2019t last for lifeRenewals bring premium increasesNo cash value component\u00a0\n\n\n Ideal for:\n\n\n Term life insurance is typically best for those who need affordable coverage during a period when they have large financial responsibilities. For example, if you\u2019re the breadwinner of your family, you may want coverage while your children are growing up and you\u2019re paying off your mortgage.\u00a0\n\n\n  Whole Life Insurance (Permanent)  \n Whole life insurance policies offer coverage for the rest of your life\u2014as long as you pay your premiums. They come with a fixed death benefit and a fixed monthly premium. Both are established when you initially sign up and stay the same as long as you keep the policy active. When you pass away, your death benefit gets paid out to your named beneficiary.\n\n\n\nLife insurance premiums are based on factors including age and health. The younger and healthier you are when you sign up, the lower the rate you can lock in for life.\n In addition to a fixed death benefit, whole life policies come with a cash value savings component. Every time you make a premium payment, part of the payment goes toward your cash value. Interest then accrues on that money according to a fixed rate.\n\n\n You can withdraw from or borrow against your cash value account during your life. However, that amount will be deducted from the death benefit your beneficiary receives. You could choose to pay back a cash value loan to return to the original death benefit.\n\n\n Features\n\n\n Permanent policyCash value component, which can be used for loans, withdrawals, or to pay premiumsFixed premium and death benefitGuaranteed cash value growth\n\n\n Pros\n\n\n Predictable premium paymentsGuaranteed death benefit amountCoverage for lifeCan borrow against or withdraw from cash value, or use it to pay premiums\n\n\n Cons\n\n\n Initially, much more expensive than term lifeCash value may grow slower than with other policiesNo flexibility to adjust the premium or the death benefit\n\n\n Ideal for:\n\n\n If you\u2019re looking for a predictable and low-maintenance life insurance policy that\u2019ll cover you for the rest of your life, whole insurance can be a good fit. It helps you leave behind a sizable amount of tax-free money to your loved ones and gives you access to money during your life. On the downside, it does initially come at a much higher cost than term life insurance. But the premiums will not increase as you get older, as they do with other types of insurance, including term insurance renewal.\n\n\n  Universal Life Insurance (Permanent)  \n Universal life insurance is another permanent policy that\u2019s designed to cover you for the rest of your life, as long as you pay the premiums and don\u2019t deplete your cash value.\n\n\n Like whole life insurance, it has a cash value savings component. However, unlike whole life, your premium and death benefit won\u2019t be fixed. You can adjust them up or down to better suit your budget throughout your lifetime.\n\n\n You must pay enough to cover the policy\u2019s underlying insurance cost though, which goes up as you get older. By design, you\u2019re supposed to pay more than the insurance cost to build cash value when you\u2019re younger so that it helps cover the rising insurance costs as you get older. Otherwise, your premiums will go up.\n\n\n Another difference between whole life and universal life is that interest on the cash value of a whole life policy accrues at a fixed rate, while interest on a universal policy accrues according to market interest rates. As a result, you can earn more when the market is up but can also earn less when the market is down. That said, many insurers have minimum performance guarantees for the cash value interest return.\n\n\n Features\n\n\n Permanent life insurance policyAdjustable premiums and death benefitCash value component, which can be used for loans, withdrawals, or to pay premiumsCash value interest accrual linked to market interest rates\n\n\n Pros\n\n\n Permanent policyCash value can go toward loans, withdrawals, or premiumsFlexible premiums and death benefit\n\n\n Cons\u00a0\n\n\n Requires budgeting to maintain coveragePremiums go up if not enough cash value is saved\u00a0Cash value is more exposed to risk\n\n\n Ideal for:\n\n\n Universal life insurance can be a good fit for those who want permanent coverage but also want more flexibility when it comes to their monthly payments. It\u2019s also a good fit for those who are comfortable with a bit more risk due to the cash value being linked to market interest rates.\u00a0\n\n\n  Variable Universal Life Insurance (Permanent)  \n Variable universal life insurance is another type of permanent life insurance with a cash value savings component. The difference with this policy is that you invest your cash value into assets like mutual funds. As a result, your cash value\u2019s growth will depend on the performance of your investments.\n\n\n However, many insurers let you allocate part of your premium to a fixed account with a guaranteed rate of return to limit your risk. This type of policy also offers flexibility when it comes to your death benefit and premium amount.\u00a0\n\n\n Features\n\n\n Permanent policyCash value growth tied to investmentsFlexible premiums and death benefit\n\n\n Pros\n\n\n Permanent policyFlexible paymentsCash value component, which can go toward loans, withdrawals, or premiumsInvestment options can help you grow your cash value fasterGives you control over how your cash value is investedPart of cash value can have a fixed rate of return\u00a0\n\n\n Cons\n\n\n Risk of poor cash value growth and even lossesInvestment losses could lead to a reduced death benefitMore fees and charges than other permanent policies\u00a0More complex than other life insurance types\n\n\n Ideal for:\n\n\n A variable universal life insurance policy is going to be best for those who are investment-savvy and want more control over their cash value\u2019s growth. You\u2019ll be the one deciding where to allocate the funds so it\u2019s important to have some investment know-how, along with an understanding of the risk and reward potential at play. It can be a good fit for people who\u2019ve already maxed out their retirement contributions and want to build additional savings for retirement.\n\n\n  Final Expense Life Insurance (Permanent)  \n Final expense insurance, also known as burial insurance, is designed to cover end-of-life expenses such as a person\u2019s funeral. You don\u2019t normally need to undergo a medical exam to get approved, unless you have a serious pre-existing medical condition. Insurers may offer guaranteed acceptance for people in a certain age group. For example, Mutual of Omaha guarantees acceptance for applicants between the ages of 45 and 85.\n\n\n In exchange for having no medical exam, final expense insurance charges higher premiums versus policies that do require a medical exam. Final expense policies also have low maximum coverage amounts. This is what keeps monthly premium payments relatively low, but they\u2019re likely to be even lower if you can get a small whole life policy that requires a medical exam.\n\n\n Features\n\n\n Permanent coverageNo medical exam is required in most casesLower coverage amounts\u00a0Higher premiums for the amount of coverage offeredSome offer guaranteed acceptance for age groupsCash value component, which you can borrow or withdraw against, or use to pay premiums\n\n\n Pros\n\n\n Low coverage amounts keep monthly payments relatively affordableSometimes guaranteed for elderly age groupsNo medical exam is required in many casesPermanent coverageCash value component can go toward loans, withdrawals, or premiums\n\n\n Cons\n\n\n Lower maximum coverage amountsHigher premiums than policies that require medical examsMay not be available over a certain age (e.g. 85)Medical exams may be required for severe health conditions\n\n\n Ideal for:\n\n\n Final expense insurance is often a good choice for people who find other insurance policies inaccessible. It can provide a way to get coverage for your funeral, burial, and final bills if you\u2019re getting toward the end of life and don\u2019t have other resources to cover those expenses. \u00a0\n\n\n  Other Types of Life Insurance  \n In addition to the main types of life insurance, here are a few other variations you may come across when shopping around.\n\n\n  Short-Term Life Insurance  \n Short-term life insurance provides coverage for a very short period, such as one year. It\u2019s designed for those who want loved ones to receive a death benefit if they pass in the near future. For example, Progressive offers one-year policies up to $200,000 that don\u2019t require a medical exam. You might want that kind of policy to fill a temporary gap, such as if you\u2019re in between jobs.\n\n\n  Variable Life Insurance  \n Variable life insurance is permanent coverage that lets you invest your cash value in a portfolio of subaccounts, the same as variable universal life insurance. The key difference is that the premiums on variable life insurance are fixed. You cannot adjust them up and down.\n\n\n  Indexed Universal Life Insurance (IUL)  \n Indexed Universal Life Insurance is a variation of universal life insurance that allows your cash value component to earn interest by tracking a stock market index chosen by your insurer. You can enjoy flexible premiums along with the chance to earn more interest. However, there\u2019s also the chance you\u2019ll earn less. These policies have more return upside and risk than whole life but less than variable and variable universal life.\u00a0\n\n\n  Supplemental Life Insurance\u00a0  \n Supplemental life insurance is an option for additional coverage that\u2019s offered by some employers. If you find that the life insurance benefits your employee provides for free fall short of your needs but supplemental life insurance is available, you could consider adding it at your own expense.\n\n\n Keep in mind, the policy types available will vary from one insurer to the next. To find the best deal, shop around and browse the offerings and pricing from at least three reputable life insurance companies.\n\n\n  How to Choose the Right Life Insurance Plan  \n Choosing the right life insurance plan for you and your loved ones is going to depend on a variety of factors. A good place to start is to think about why you want the policy. What do you hope to achieve from the death benefit and for whom?\n\n\n For example, do you want to cover your end-of-life expenses, do you want to pass on an inheritance, or do you want to ensure your family is supported financially if you unexpectedly pass? Your answers can help to point you in the right direction.\n\n\n Beyond that, other factors to consider include:\n\n\n What you can qualify for: Life insurance requires you to fill out an application and undergo an approval process. Your ability to qualify for coverage will depend on factors like your age, lifestyle habits, and medical history. You\u2019ll want to find out if there are any plans that aren\u2019t available to you.Your budget: How much can you spend on a life insurance policy per month and per year? The costs will vary greatly by the plan type and coverage amount you choose. Term life policies start as the most affordable but have a set expiration date.\u00a0Whether you prefer predictability or flexibility: Term and whole life policies offer fixed premiums and death benefits, while other policies like universal life allow more flexibility. You\u2019ll want to weigh the options to decide which is best for your budget and goals.\u00a0If you want to build cash value: Are you looking to build cash value that you can withdraw or borrow against? If so, that will rule out term life policies.\u00a0If you want control over your cash value\u2019s growth: You\u2019ll also need to consider how you want your cash value funds to be managed. Would you prefer a fixed rate of return? Then, a whole life policy would be best. If you want it attached to market interest rates, universal life would be the way to go. Further, variable life gives you a more hands-on situation where you can invest in a portfolio of sub-accounts.\n\n\n By identifying your needs and understanding what the different types of life insurance policies offer, you can weigh your options to find the best fit for your situation. Then, you\u2019ll be ready to shop around to find the best deal.\u00a0\n\n\n What Is a Life Insurance Annuity?\nIf you die while covered by a life insurance policy, your beneficiary has options on how to receive the death benefit. If they are worried about budgeting the money all at once, they could instead select a life insurance annuity. The insurance company splits the death benefit funds over payments guaranteed for a set number of years or even for the rest of the beneficiary\u2019s life\u2014the plan will be worked out with the beneficiary. The payments include interest.\n\n\n What Type of Life Insurance Can You Borrow From?\nYou can borrow from life insurance policies that have a cash value component, which includes most permanent policy options. Part of each premium you pay goes to the cash value savings account, which accrues interest over time. You can then withdraw from it or borrow against it during your lifetime.\n\n\n Can You Cash in Life Insurance While Still Alive?\nPolicyholders are able to cash out their life insurance policies while alive. The first way to do so is to surrender the policy. In this case, you can take the surrender value cash payment, which is often subject to surrender fees. If your policy has a cash value component, you can also opt to keep your policy in place and borrow against it or withdraw from it. Doing so will reduce the future death benefit, though.\n\n\n  The Bottom Line  \n Life insurance can help you financially support loved ones after you pass away. Whether you want to cover your end-of-life expenses, pay off a mortgage, replace your income, or something else\u2014it provides a way to do so.\n\n\n However, the best life insurance plan for you is going to depend on various factors. It\u2019s not one-size-fits-all. Now that you understand how the main types of life insurance work, you can weigh the features, pros, and cons to decide which will be most beneficial for your situation.\u00a0If you still have questions or concerns, you can reach out to a financial advisor or insurance agent.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Sources\n\n\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Term life insurance is a simple, low-cost policy, and its main purpose is to replace your income when you die.How it works: Term life insurance is typically sold in lengths of one, five, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years. Coverage amounts vary depending on the policy but can go into the millions. Most people buy term life insurance for a length long enough to cover their prime working years. That way, if they die early, they can help a surviving spouse or other beneficiary meet short-term financial needs like paying off a mortgage or supporting their kids through college.Pros: It\u2019s often the cheapest life insurance, and it's sufficient for most people.Cons: If you outlive your policy, your beneficiaries won\u2019t receive a payout.Learn about the best term life insurance companiesThese carriers topped our list of the best term life insurance companies in 2024.InsurerNerdWallet ratingGuardian5.0NerdWallet rating\u00a0NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

In general, your premiums stay the same, you get a guaranteed rate of return on the policy\u2019s cash value, and the death benefit amount doesn\u2019t change.Pros: It usually covers you for your entire life, builds cash value and is relatively simple compared with other permanent life insurance options.Cons: It\u2019s typically more expensive than term life, so if you're looking for affordable life insurance, you might want to explore other options.Learn about the best whole life insurance companiesWhole life insurance is a lengthy financial commitment, so you want to compare your options.

But generally, this type of coverage allows you to adjust your premiums (within limits) and has a cash value component that grows based on market interest rates. Premiums typically increase over time, forcing you to increase your premium payments or cover rising costs by subtracting from your cash value account or death benefit. Universal life insurance is different from indexed universal life insurance \u2014 with those policies, the cash value growth is tied to a stock or bond index like the S&P 500.Pros: It\u2019s typically less expensive than whole life insurance and can adapt to your needs as life changes.Cons: The death benefit and cash value growth are not guaranteed.\u00bb MORE: What is universal life insurance? Pros, cons and cost\u2191 Back to topVariable life insuranceBest for: Those with a higher risk tolerance who want greater control over their cash value investments.How it works: This type of cash value life insurance is tied to investment accounts, such as bonds and mutual funds. Variable life insurance premiums are typically fixed and the death benefit is guaranteed, regardless of how the market fares. If you\u2019re considering a policy like this, a fee-only financial advisor \u2014 a planner who doesn\u2019t earn commissions based on product sales \u2014 can help you choose the best one.Pros: There is potential for considerable gains if your investment choices do well.Cons: It requires you to be hands-on in managing your policy because the cash value can change daily based on the market.\ud83e\udd13Nerdy TipSome insurers offer a hybrid policy known as variable universal life insurance. This has similar features to variable life insurance, except the premiums are adjustable \u2014 which may suit those who don\u2019t want to commit to paying the same amount in premiums each month.\u00bb MORE: A guide to variable life and variable universal life insurance\u2191 Back to topBurial insurance or final expense insuranceBest for: People who want to cover their own funeral, burial and other end-of-life expenses.How it works: Also known as final expense insurance, burial insurance is a small whole life insurance policy that is meant to help your family pay for your funeral, burial and other expenses after your death, like outstanding medical bills. The death benefit is guaranteed and typically ranges from $5,000 to $25,000.Pros: A medical exam isn\u2019t typically required, making it more accessible to seniors with pre-existing health conditions.Cons: Coverage is capped at low amounts. If you die within two or three years of taking out your policy, your insurer may not pay the full death benefit.Learn about the best burial insurance companiesThese insurers made our list of the best burial insurance companies in 2024.InsurerNerdWallet ratingAge eligibilityState Farm5.0NerdWallet rating\u00a0NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Premiums are based on the group as a whole rather than each individual. In general, employers offer basic coverage for free, with the option to purchase supplemental life insurance if you need more coverage.Mortgage life insurance covers the current balance of your mortgage and pays out to the lender, not your family, if you die.Credit life insurance pays the balance of a specific loan, like a home equity loan. Your bank might offer to sell you a credit life insurance policy when you take out a loan. If you die, the policy pays off the lender, not your family.Accidental death and dismemberment insurance covers you if you die in an accident, such as a car crash. AD&D insurance also pays out for the loss of limbs as well as the loss of your sight or hearing \u2014 but it\u2019s typically offered only through the workplace.Joint life insurance insures two lives, usually those of spouses, under one policy:First-to-die: Pays out after the first policyholder dies. The policy would then expire; it doesn\u2019t continue to cover the second person. These policies are extremely rare because the demand for them is low.Second-to-die: Pays out after both policyholders die. These policies can be used to cover estate taxes or the care of a dependent after both policyholders die.\u00bb MORE: Compare life insurance quotes\u2191 Back to topFind the right life insurance plan for youMake sure you and your loved ones are covered - compare customized life insurance quotes from our partners.Compare with PolicygeniusDifferent types of life insurance by underwritingUnderwriting refers to how a life insurance company calculates the risks of insuring you. A policy\u2019s underwriting determines a few things, like how quickly your coverage will go in force, whether you\u2019ll need to take a medical exam and the price you\u2019ll pay.There are three main types of life insurance underwriting:Fully underwritten life insuranceIf you're healthy, fully underwritten policies will generally be the cheapest option.This is because the life insurance application process typically includes a medical exam and questions about your health as well as questions about your family\u2019s health history, your hobbies and your travel plans.Insurers use this data to price the policy more accurately based on your specific life expectancy. To get the most favorable rate, aim to provide as much information as possible when filling out your application.Simplified issue life insuranceSimplified issue policies don\u2019t require you to take a medical exam. However, you may be asked a few health questions and could be turned down based on your answers.Instant-approval life insurance policies use quick, online health questionnaires as well as algorithms and big data to speed up the application process.Guaranteed issue life insuranceGuaranteed issue life insurance requires no medical exams and no health questions. In short, you can\u2019t be turned down for coverage if you\u2019re within the eligible age range, which is typically 40 to 85. However, this is an expensive way to buy life insurance, and coverage amounts are generally low.In addition, these policies have graded death benefits, which means if you die within the first few years of having the policy, your beneficiaries may receive only a partial payout. People often buy this type of life insurance if they\u2019ve been turned down elsewhere because of their health but they want to cover final expenses, such as funeral costs.Which type of life insurance should you get?Still not sure which type of life insurance is right for you?
