Term life is more affordable but lasts only for a set period of time. On the other hand, whole life insurance tends to have higher premiums but never expires. Knowing the differences between term and whole life insurance will help you choose a policy that works best for you and your lifestyle. 4 min to readExplore Progressive's editorial standards for Answers articles to find out why you can trust the insurance information you find here.AnswersLife insurance informationTerm vs. whole life insurance: What are the differences?Get quoteHow does term life insurance work?\nTerm life insurance typically lasts from 10 to 30 years, depending on how long you want coverage. If you die while your policy is still active, then your beneficiary receives the death benefit payout. Since it lasts for a set period of time, term life is more affordable than permanent life insurance but still offers similar payout amounts.\nTerm life can also be purchased to supplement whole life insurance during certain life events, such as buying a home. If something were to happen to you, your family could pay off the mortgage with the death benefit from your term policy, leaving the payout from your permanent policy for other expenses.\nHow does whole life insurance work?\nWhole life insurance provides lifelong coverage as long as you pay your premiums. No matter when you die, your beneficiary will receive the death benefit payout. It also has a cash value savings component that builds in value over time, which you can use to pay your premiums or borrow against in the form of a life insurance loan.\nImportant note: If you withdraw or borrow against your policy's cash value without repaying it, you will reduce the cash value and death benefit of your policy.\nTerm vs. whole life insurance: Key differences\nThe differences between term life insurance and whole life insurance generally come down to four factors: cost, coverage length, cash value, and complexity. FeatureTerm life insurance Whole life insuranceCostTerm life insurance Lower premiumsWhole life insuranceHigher premiumsCoverage lengthTerm life insurance You choose, typically between 10 and 30 yearsWhole life insuranceLasts your entire life if you pay your premiumsCash value?Term life insurance NoWhole life insuranceYes, grows in value over time at a fixed rateComplexityTerm life insurance Coverage is straightforward, with fixed premiums and death benefitWhole life insuranceCoverage is more complex, as the death benefit amount can change if you have an outstanding loan against your policy's cash valueThe pros and cons of term and whole life insurance are clear: Term life insurance is simpler and more affordable but has an expiration date and doesn't include a cash value feature. Whole life insurance is more expensive and complex, but it provides lifelong coverage and builds cash value over time. Choosing between the two will come down to your specific needs and financial situation.\nReasons to consider term life insurance\nYou're looking for low-cost coverage: Term life generally offers lower premiums compared to whole life and other types of permanent life insurance, making it easier to fit in a budget.   You don't need lifelong coverage: If you only need financial protection for a certain number of years, say while your kids are still dependent on you, then term life insurance may be the right fit for you. You want to supplement a whole life policy: As mentioned earlier, it may make sense to take out a separate term life policy to supplement a whole life policy in order to cover larger debts, such as a mortgage. Your beneficiaries could then use your whole life policy's payout to cover other expenses.You may want a whole life policy later: Many term life insurance policies include a conversion rider that allows you to switch from term life to whole life insurance. When and how you can convert your policy will vary by insurer, so make sure you clarify the details with your insurer when applying for a term life policy.\nReasons to consider whole life insurance\nYou want a policy that builds cash value: A whole life policy with cash value gives you greater financial flexibility, and you can also use it to pay your premiums. You want or need lifelong coverage: Since it lasts for your lifetime, whole life insurance is more suitable for end-of-life planning, such as covering funeral expenses and leaving an inheritance for your children. You can also use whole life insurance to provide funds for loved ones who will need ongoing care, such as a child with a lifelong disability or an elderly parent that you support.\nAlternatives to term and whole life insurance\nThere are other types of life insurance you may consider that offer more options or fit a specific need:\nUniversal life insurance: Like whole life, universal life insurance offers lifelong coverage, but it offers you greater flexibility. For example, you can adjust or skip premium payments, as well as change your death benefit amount. Variable life insurance: Variable life insurance also lasts for your entire life and includes a guaranteed death benefit, but the cash value component grows based on specific investments you select. This policy type is a bit riskier than others and carries additional fees. Indexed universal life insurance (IUL): Another form of universal life insurance, only with this policy type your cash value grows based on the performance of a set grouping of stocks. As with variable life, IUL is riskier than traditional whole and universal life policies. 1-year term life insurance: Meant for short-term coverage gaps, such as being in between jobs, one-year term life policies can give you low-cost coverage while you look for a new job or figure out your long-term coverage needs. \nIf you're still unsure what type of life insurance is right for you, call 1-866-912-2477 to speak with a licensed Progressive Life by eFinancial representative.

Understanding the difference between term and whole life insurance is a valuable part of the decision. At Aflac, we offer a variety of life insurance plans to help meet your specific needs.\nAccording to LIMRA, 52% of Americans reported owning some type of life insurance in January 2023. This included individual life insurance, employer-sponsored coverage, etc.1 Picking the right life insurance policy can greatly impact your retirement plan and your family\u2019s financial security.\nWhat is Term Life Insurance?\nWhen deciding between term or whole life insurance, there are crucial differences to take note of. Like it sounds, term life insurance provides coverage for a set term or specific amount of time. They usually vary between 10 and 30 years long. If the policyholder passes away during that specified period, your beneficiary will receive the payout.\nThe cost of whole life insurance vs. term varies, but term life insurance usually costs less. It costs less because there is only a payout if the timing aligns. We hope that you outlive your term, but if not, the payout can help provide support for your loved ones.\nYou are also able to choose your term based on your unique situation, possibly reducing costs in the long run. This choice is popular for young families because of the lower premiums upfront. It can also be a good choice for seniors factoring in their long-term plans.\nWhat is Whole Life Insurance?\nWhen wondering, \u201cshould I buy term life insurance or whole life?\u201d there are a few key takeaways. Whole life insurance provides coverage for your entire life cycle. Typically, whole life insurance costs more because it serves as an investment. This investment, otherwise known as the cash value, is able to grow throughout your lifetime tax-free.\nWhen deciding between term or whole life insurance, you should note the following about whole life insurance. The premiums will not change throughout the course of your life and the death benefit is certain. You do not need to choose a term length. Lastly, the cash value will grow in a tax-deferred account at a secured rate. This is a popular choice for those looking to maximize their financial potential.\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About Term and Whole Life Insurance\nPeace of mind doesn't have to break the bank\nDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Help cover yourself and your family with coverage from Aflac.\n\nGet a Quote\n\n\n\n\nTerm vs. Whole Life Insurance Pros and Cons\nThere are a few crucial differences in term and whole life insurance. We want to make it easy for you by breaking those differences down into pros and cons.\n\nTerm Life Insurance Pros: It\u2019s customizable, specific to your timeline, and usually costs less than whole life insurance.\nTerm Life insurance Cons: If you outlive the term length, your coverage will end and you won\u2019t receive any benefits. You will not be covered your entire lifetime and your policy will not accumulate cash value like an investment account does.\nWhole Life insurance Pros: The premiums will always be the same amount, the payout is guaranteed (subject to limitations and exclusions), and the value of your plan grows at a constant rate.\nWhole Life Insurance Cons: You cannot choose the length of the policy and it\u2019s typically more expensive than term life insurance.\n\nCost of Whole Life Insurance vs. Term Life Insurance\nChoosing between whole life and term life insurance depends on your financial goals. We encourage you to determine what kind of financial security you\u2019d like in place throughout your lifetime. This will allow you to assess the costs and the long-term value of term and whole life insurance accurately.\nOne of the main differences between whole and term life insurance is the cost. The costs of either plan vary depending on age group, gender, and medical history. Even so, whole life insurance tends to have higher premiums than term life insurance. The premiums are higher because the payments are put into an account that accumulates over time. This can provide you more security when the time comes.\nTerm life insurance usually has lower premiums. If you choose a 30-year term at a lower rate and your timeline is correct, your family can still receive ample security and possibly avoid higher premiums.\nWhich is Better: Term or Whole Life Insurance?\nBy now, you\u2019ve read our analysis of whole life versus term life insurance. One isn\u2019t necessarily better than the other, but one can be more suited for your unique needs.\nWe encourage to take a closer look at the costs and decide how much you are willing to spend on a policy. Considering your dependents and who you aim to support is also a key component. Lastly, you should make sure that there isn\u2019t a better option out there for your investment purposes.\nTerm and Whole Life Insurance Alternatives\nYour permanent life insurance options don\u2019t end here. There are additional alternatives outside of whole and term life insurance.\nUniversal Life insurance is a great option if you want part of your policy to function as a savings account. Variable Life insurance uses sub-accounts that function similarly to mutual funds. Lastly, Indexed Universal Life Insurance allows you to adjust your premiums to maximize your cash policy\u2019s cash value.\nThese options are generally only suited for specific financial goals. Most people choose between a term or whole life insurance policy. Aflac can work with you to recommend a plan that best meets your needs.\nAlternatives to Term and Whole Life Insurance\nIf term and whole life insurance aren\u2019t for you, here are some alternative policies to consider: \n\nUniversal life insurance: This is a permanent policy that offers lifelong coverage. Similar to whole life insurance, this type of policy comes with a cash value component in addition to the death benefit. The cash value grows based on current market rates. Premiums you pay can be adjusted throughout the policy term and can increase or decrease depending on your needs.\n\nGuaranteed issue life insurance: This type of life insurance is designed for individuals who may not qualify for traditional life insurance policies due to pre-existing medical conditions or lifestyle choices. These policies require no medical exams, provide immediate coverage at a fixed rate, and come with a small death benefit.\n\nFinal expense insurance: Final expense insurance is designed to help cover end-of-life costs, such as funeral expenses and hospital bills. This type of policy typically comes with low premiums and a small death benefit. Unlike other types of permanent life insurance, final expense policies are typically available without taking physical exams, but some insurance companies will still ask questions about certain aspects related to your health prior to approving coverage.\n\nWhat to Consider Before Getting Term or Whole Life Insurance\nWhen deciding whether to get term of whole life insurance, it\u2019s important to consider several factors: \n\nCoverage needs: The first step is to determine how much coverage you should get based on your current financial situation. If you only need coverage for a few years while your children are growing up, for example, then term life insurance may be the right choice. But if you want lifetime coverage and the ability to build cash value, then consider whole life insurance.\n\nCash value: When deciding whether to get term or whole life insurance, you should also consider whether you want to build cash value. If you want the ability to build wealth and withdraw or borrow funds as needed, then a whole life policy may be the right choice for you.\n\nCosts: Finally, it's smart to consider the costs when deciding which type of policy is right for you. If you\u2019re on a budget and just want to provide coverage for your family, term life plans are often the most cost-effective option. On the other hand, if you're looking for lifelong protection with more investment potential, then whole life insurance may be a better choice.\n\nUltimately, the type of policy you choose should depend on your individual needs and financial circumstances. Consider discussing all your options with a qualified professional who can help you find the right kind of policy for you. \n\n\n\nStill have questions?\nExplore your life insurance options.\n\nGet a Quote\n\n\n \n\n\nDisclaimer             \n\n\n1 LIMRA.

While most people know that life insurance will pay a sum of money to their beneficiaries if they pass away, they may need help explaining the differences and benefits of term life insurance vs. whole life insurance. If you want to help protect your family\u2019s financial future, it\u2019s important to know the basics about these two options.This article can help you find the best type of life insurance for your needs by answering some key questions about the differences between term vs. whole life insurance:What is term life insurance?What is whole life insurance?What are the pros and cons of each kind of policy?What should you consider before buying a policy?What is term life insurance?A term life insurance policy is precisely what the name implies: It provides coverage for a specific term or period of time, typically between 10 and 30 years. It is sometimes called \"pure life insurance\" because, unlike whole life insurance, this policy has no cash value component\u2014it's designed purely to give your beneficiaries a payout if you pass away during the term.If you get a term policy to help protect your family, you should consider whether your family\u2019s need for life insurance will change before the term expires. For most people, that means the kids are grown up and on their own, the house is paid off, and there\u2019s some money that can serve as stability for the surviving spouse.Curious about the cost of term life insurance? Use our term life insurance cost calculator to estimate monthly premiums. What is whole life insurance? A whole life policy is the simplest form of permanent life insurance, named because it provides coverage that lasts your entire life as long as premiums are paid.1 Unlike term, it\u2019s not a \"pure life insurance\" product because it includes a cash value component.2 A policy has cash value when a portion of your premium dollars can grow over time on a tax-deferred basis, so you don\u2019t pay taxes on the gains.3A policy\u2019s cash value provides a number of benefits that you can use while you\u2019re still alive. It takes a few years to grow into a useful amount. Still, once that happens, you can borrow money against your policy\u2019s cash value in the form of loans or withdrawals4, use it to pay your premiums, or even surrender it for cash to help supplement your retirement income.While there are other types of permanent life insurance, whole life is the simplest:The premium remains the same for lifeThe death benefit is guaranteedThe cash value grows at a guaranteed rateNote that with some companies, such as Guardian, whole life policies can also earn annual dividends (a portion of the insurer\u2019s profits) that can increase your cash value and provide other benefits. While not guaranteed, Guardian has paid dividends to participating individual life policyholders every year since 1868.5Key differences between term and whole life insuranceThere are several significant differences between term and whole life insurance.The most significant difference between the two types of policies is that while both pay a death benefit to your beneficiaries, term life only covers you for a set period, while whole life offers permanent (lifelong) coverage as long as premiums are paid. Plus, whole life features a cash value component that accumulates funds over time. The added value of whole life insurance and the certainty that the insurer will eventually have to pay a death benefit can mean that a whole life policy premium is higher than for a term policy. Here are some of the other features and differences that can help you decide which type of policy is best for your needs:Policy featureTerm life insuranceWhole life insuranceInitial premiumTypically lowerTypically higher than term insurancePremium over timeMay remain the same or increase over timeGuaranteed to remain the samePermanent coverageNoYesLength of coverageTypically, 10-30 years.

When you consider all the benefits that a whole policy can provide over the course of your life \u2013 and the certainty of an eventual payout \u2013 you may feel it\u2019s a better overall value, depending on your situation. Reasons to consider term life insuranceYou may want to choose term life insurance if: You\u2019re most concerned about coverage for a specific period of time: Term life policies are often used to protect beneficiaries until they no longer need financial protection. For instance, many people with young children purchase a term policy that will end when the children are out of college and able to provide for themselves. You want (or need) more cost-effective coverage: Term life insurance typically comes with more cost-effective monthly premiums than whole life insurance\u2014 especially if you\u2019re young and healthy. For some, this may be desirable, while for others it\u2019s all they can afford. Remember that you may be able to convert your term life policy to whole life coverage later.You aren\u2019t concerned about accumulating cash value: The cash value accumulation offered by whole life is not important to you. You want to help supplement a whole life policy: Some policyholders take out multiple policies. They may have a whole life policy but choose to supplement it with a term life policy for a set period of time\u2014say, until their mortgage is paid off or their children are out of the house. You want the flexibility of term coverage. There are plenty of different term options \u2014 including 10-year and 20-year terms \u2014 allowing you to choose the coverage period that best aligns with your circumstances and needs. Reasons to consider whole life insurance You may want to choose whole life insurance if:You want lifelong coverage: Whole life insurance provides permanent coverage that spans your entire lifetime, as long as premiums are paid. It can be suitable for end-of-life planning and can help cover expenses related to funerals and medical debt. It can also provide ongoing financial support for a spouse or dependent family member, or an inheritance to beneficiaries. You can afford the higher premiums: Whole life insurance offers lifetime coverage and other key benefits but can cost you more than term life.You want a policy that builds guaranteed cash value: Whole life insurance offers a cash value component that can grow on an income tax-deferred basis, which makes it a popular savings vehicle.You have dependent family members: If you have dependent family members\u2014 particularly lifelong dependent family members, like a child or sibling with disabilities\u2014 whole life insurance can offer significant protection. You can use life insurance to fund a trust to provide care for your dependent family member. You want the option to borrow against the cash value of the policy: Once you\u2019ve paid a certain amount into the policy with premiums, you may be able to make a withdrawal or take out a loan against the policy. This may offer financial flexibility later in life, though it may lower the death benefit if not repaid in full. How much will each kind of policy cost me?Many factors contribute to the cost of a life insurance policy \u2013 some you can\u2019t control, but others you can. Policy type (term or permanent), age, health, gender, driving record, occupation, hobbies, and the amount your loved ones would receive all contribute to the cost. By learning what may impact your premiums before you get a life insurance policy quote, you can better understand your options when choosing what\u2019s best for you and your family.What if you already have one type of policy but want another? We\u2019ve talked about the different options and features that a whole life insurance policy provides compared to a term policy and the fact that a term policy may be a more cost-effective way to purchase a given level of the death benefit. But no matter which kind of policy you have, you may be able to get the benefits of the other type. How?You may be able to convert your term policy into a whole life policy: Most companies (but not all) allow for this, and it can be an excellent way to continue your life insurance policy and build cash value from which you can borrow.You can also buy a term policy to help supplement your whole life policy: For example, if you feel you want an added level of protection to and the possibility to help supplement payment for your children\u2019s college, a whole life policy can build cash value.Alternatives to term and whole life insuranceTerm and whole life insurance are the most common types of life insurance. There are, however, alternatives that you might want to consider.Universal life insurance, like whole life insurance, is a type of permanent life insurance. Unlike whole life insurance, you can raise or lower premiums within certain limits.6 This may make it easier to afford at times of financial stress, but it can also affect cash value growth. Equally important, the total death payout may decline if you make too many minimum premium payments. One more note \u2014 with indexed universal life insurance, you can align a portion of your cash value with a stock market index, which gives you the potential for higher returns.7Variable universal life insurance is a type of universal life insurance that offers permanent protections when premiums are paid.8 It offers flexibility in terms of premiums and the ability to invest through subaccounts. Like universal life insurance, the flexibility of variable life insurance does have a cost, and it could impact your overall cash value or death payout. Annuities insurance contracts that you can purchase with a lump sum payment or a stream of premium payments.9 In return for your investment, you\u2019ll receive a regular income stream, which can start immediately or at a later date when you are closer to retirement. As with cash value life insurance, the funds invested in an annuity grow tax-deferred. Annuities can pay you for a set period or for your entire lifetime. Many people purchase annuities to help ensure that they will have a consistent income stream through retirement. Others want to help ensure that their beneficiaries will have a consistent income stream in the event of their death. After all is said and done, which type of policy should I buy? The truth is there are many things to consider besides the type of life insurance policy you get. How much coverage do you need? What are all the different policy options (or riders)?10 Is there other coverage I need to protect my family?Here\u2019s an easy way to get answers to all those questions: Contact Guardian to find a financial professional who will take the time to learn about your unique situation, listen to your concerns, and clearly explain the different options that best fit your needs and your budget \u2013 from a life insurance company that\u2019s been helping protect families for over 160 years.If you are an employee, taking advantage of your benefits at work can be a smart and cost-effective way to get the financial protection you want for yourself and your family. Consider contacting your HR department to review your plan details and determine how much life insurance may be available to you. Your employer may provide life insurance as a benefit, or you may opt to pay for additional life insurance through payroll deductions.Customer serviceContact Us1-888-Guardian (1-888-482-7342)Submit a ClaimResourcesForms & ClaimsFind a dental or vision providerFind a financial professionalCareersIndustry ProfessionalsFind a Guardian benefits sales officeNew case implementation trackerLiving Balance Sheetopens in a new windowopens in a new windowopens in a new windowopens in a new windowopens in a new windowLegal InformationTerms & conditions Privacy policy DisclosuresIndividual products benefit disclosuresCybersecurityAccessibilityLanguage assistanceTelehealth NY Reg. 200Confidentiality for domestic violence victimsSEC Rule 606Amendments to broker agreementState disaster updatesMDG TX notice to providersAgreement to conduct business electronicallyReport suspected fraudDo not sell or share my personal informationGuardian\u00ae is a registered trademark of The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, New York, NY.Copyright\u00a9 2024 The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. All rights reserved.Disclaimer2024-174139 202605311 All whole life insurance policy guarantees are subject to the timely payment of all required premiums and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Policy loans and withdrawals affect the guarantees by reducing the policy\u2019s death benefit and cash values.2 Some whole life polices do not have cash values in the first two years of the policy and don\u2019t pay a dividend until the policy\u2019s third year. Talk to your financial representative and refer to your individual whole life policy illustration for more information.3 Guardian, its subsidiaries, agents and employees do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. Consult your tax, legal, or accounting professional regarding your individual situation. The information provided is based on our general understanding of the subject matter discussed and is for informational purposes only.4 Policy benefits are reduced by any outstanding loan or loan interest and/or withdrawals. Dividends, if any, are affected by policy loans and loan interest. Withdrawals above the cost basis may result in taxable ordinary income. If the policy lapses, or is surrendered, any outstanding loans considered gain in the policy may be subject to ordinary income taxes. If the policy is a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC), loans are treated like withdrawals but as gain first, subject to ordinary income taxes. If the policy owner is under 59 \u00bd, any taxable withdrawal may also be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty.5 Dividends are not guaranteed. They are declared annually by Guardian\u2019s Board of Directors.6 A Universal Life Insurance (UL) policy provides a flexible premium, choice of death benefit options, and a guaranteed crediting rate e.g. 2%). Policy growth is based on adequate funding, increasing crediting rates, and if costs of insurance is lower than expected. If any of the three factors just mentioned are lower than expected (policy funding and crediting rates), and/or higher than expected (cost of insurance), the policy may lapse. 7 An Indexed Universal Life (IUL) policy is not considered a security. Premium and death benefit types are flexible. It\u2019s crediting rate is based on the performance of a stock index with a cap rate (e.g. 10%), a floor (e.g. 0%), and a participation rate (e.g., 100%). This type of universal life policy may lapse due to low or negative performance of the stock index, inadequate funding, and increasing cost of insurance rates.8 A Variable Universal Life (VUL) policy is considered both life insurance and a security and is sold with a prospectus. Premium and death benefit types are flexible. It\u2019s crediting rate is based on the performance of the underlying investment options provided in the policy. There is no guaranteed interest rate. This type of policy may lapse due to low or negative performance of the underlying investment options, inadequate funding, and increasing cost of insurance rates. See your policy prospectus for more information.9 Annuity guarantees are backed by the strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.10 Riders may incur an additional cost or premium. Riders may not be available in all states.11 Permanent life insurance consists of two types: whole life and universal life. Cash value grows in a participating whole life policy through dividends, which are declared annually by the company's board of directors and are not guaranteed. Cash value grows in a universal life policy through credited interest and decreased insurance costs. The cash value of both policy types benefits when the policyholder pays an amount above the required premium.12 Universal Life Insurance may lapse prematurely due to inadequate funding (low or no premium), increase in cost of insurance rates as the insured grows older, and a low interest crediting rate. This does not apply to universal life policies which have a secondary guarantee, but if the secondary guarantee requirements are not met the policy will most likely lapse.13 A Variable Universal Life (VUL) policy is considered both life insurance and a security and is sold with a prospectus. Premium and death benefit types are flexible. It\u2019s crediting rate is based on the performance of the underlying investment options provided in the policy. There is no guaranteed interest rate. This type of policy may lapse due to low or negative performance of the underlying investment options, inadequate funding, and increasing cost of insurance rates. See your policy prospectus for more information.Frequently asked questions about term vs. whole life insurance Expand allIs whole life better than term life insurance? Whole life insurance provides many benefits compared to a term life insurance policy: it is permanent, it has a cash value component, and it offers more ways to help protect your family's finances over the long term. Those features make it a better choice for many people, but if you\u2019re only looking for the biggest death benefit you can get per dollar paid in premiums, then term life insurance may be a better choice.Are whole life insurance policies worth it? Like any other financial services product, it depends on your life situation and goals. If you want life insurance coverage that lasts your entire lifetime, a whole life policy from a solid provider can be a great choice. It can also be a worthwhile option for older people concerned about estate planning and mitigating the effects of taxes on their heirs.What happens to term life insurance at the end of the term?Generally speaking, when a term life policy comes to the end of its term (or effective period), you either have to buy another policy (at a higher cost) or go without life insurance. One exception: If you have a term policy with a guaranteed renewal clause, you can renew at the end of your term on a year-by-year basis, typically at a higher rate. While expensive, it can be worthwhile if your health has declined or you are otherwise uninsurable.What are other types of permanent life insurance besides whole life? Other types of permanent life insurance coverage include universal life insurance and variable life insurance, and variable universal life insurance11,12 These policies have a cash value like a whole life policy and may let you vary your premiums, but they are more complex than a whole life policy.13 Also, the death benefit amount may not be guaranteed. To find the best life insurance policy for your needs, consider speaking with a financial professional.Are whole life and term life insurance policies taxable? In general, death benefit payouts from a life insurance policy are not taxed, but always consult your tax professional to get all the details on tax advantages.How do I know what type of policy I have at work? Look at your benefits communications or ask your HR manager. Most group life insurance plans through work offer term coverage. These life insurance options can be a good choice: premium payments tend to be cost-effective and are conveniently deducted from your paycheck, and you may be able to get coverage without a medical exam.What are the potential disadvantages of whole life insurance? The key disadvantage of whole life insurance can be the cost. Typically, premiums for a whole life policy will be higher than those for a term life policy with a comparable death benefit. That said, it\u2019s important to remember that whole life insurance offers several benefits not available with term lifeWhen should you switch from term to whole life insurance? If you have term life insurance but would like to take advantage of whole life insurance instead, the sooner you switch is typically better. Younger people and those in good health are likely to enjoy lower premiums. If your term policy is close to ending, you can time your new whole life policy to begin when it ends. If you had a 10-year policy that\u2019s ending in six months, for example, it may make financial sense to wait out the difference. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that there aren\u2019t gaps in coverage that leave you and your family financially unprotected. "

Whole life insurance can also build cash value that you can borrow against, which makes it a more complex and expensive product.With either policy, your loved ones can spend the payout however they like, such as funeral expenses, mortgage payments or college tuition. But depending on your coverage needs, one type of life insurance may be a better fit than the other.Term vs. whole life insurance at a glanceBelow are a few key differences between these two types of coverage.Term lifePolicy length: A set time period such as 10, 20 or 30 years.Cash value: None. You can't borrow against or cash out a term life insurance policy.Cost: Generally the cheapest type of life insurance.Whole lifePolicy length: Until a set age such as 100 or 120 (essentially, the rest of your life).Cash value: Accumulates at a guaranteed rate.Cost: Significantly more expensive than term life insurance.Term life vs. whole life ratesAnnual premiums for a $500,000 policy$33420-year term$7,440Whole lifeSample rates are for a 40-year-old man who doesn't smoke and is in excellent health. See sample rates for more ages.Term life vs. whole life insurance: OverviewTo better understand the difference between term life and whole life, here\u2019s a quick rundown on how each type of coverage works.Term life insuranceThe way term life insurance works is simple: It covers you for a fixed period of time, such as 10, 20 or 30 years, and pays out if you die during the term. If you outlive the term and your coverage ends, your beneficiaries won\u2019t receive any money. Most policies are a type of level term life; the death benefit and life insurance premiums are guaranteed to stay the same throughout the term. A decreasing term life policy is slightly different, and less common. The life insurance death benefit gets smaller over the length of the term while the premiums stay the same.Ideally, the length of your term life insurance should match the financial obligation you\u2019re covering. For example, if you're a new parent, you might buy a 20-year policy to cover you until your child no longer relies on you financially. Most life insurance companies sell term life, so it\u2019s easy to find and compare life insurance quotes online.\u00bb MORE: Best life insurance companiesWhole life insuranceWhole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance and typically costs more than term life. This is because most policies offer coverage that lasts until much later in life, such as until 90, 100 or 120 years old. Whole life insurance also has a cash value component. A portion of your premium goes toward the cash value, which can grow over time. Once you\u2019ve built up enough cash value, you can borrow against it or surrender the policy for cash.Although it\u2019s more complicated than term life, the way whole life insurance works is more straightforward than other types of permanent life insurance. Premiums remain level and the cash value grows at a guaranteed fixed rate. The death benefit is also guaranteed, but be mindful of taking out cash value loans or withdrawals without paying them back. While you\u2019re not required to repay them, your insurer will subtract any outstanding loans or withdrawals from the final death benefit paid out to your beneficiaries.Many whole life policies are \u201cparticipating\u201d life insurance policies, which means you may earn dividends based on the company\u2019s financial performance. You can use your dividends in a few different ways \u2014 including boosting your policy\u2019s cash value.\u00bb MORE: What is a mutual life insurance company?Major differences between term life and whole life insurancePolicy featureTerm lifeWhole lifeChoice of policy lengthYou can choose a policy length, typically 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years.Coverage can last your entire life, typically expiring at a specific age like 95 or 100.Cash valueNo cash value. Cash value grows at a guaranteed rate set by the insurer.PremiumsPremiums typically stay level throughout the length of the policy.Premiums typically stay level throughout the length of the policy.DividendsNo dividends. Dividends may be available through participating policies.Death benefitDeath benefit is typically level, but decreasing death benefits are available.Death benefit is typically level, but graded death benefit policies are available.**Graded death benefit policies \u2014 such as guaranteed issue life insurance \u2014 typically have a waiting, or graded, period where the full death benefit won\u2019t be paid out if you die within the first few years of taking out the policy.Cost of whole life insurance vs. term life insuranceCost is a major difference between whole and term life insurance. Term life is often the most affordable life insurance because it\u2019s temporary and has no cash value. Whole life premiums are much higher because the coverage typically lasts your lifetime, and the policy grows cash value.

Term life insurance is relatively cheap, so I have plenty of coverage. I\u2019m not worried about what happens when the policy ends \u2014 by then no one will be depending on me for financial support, so I won\u2019t need that coverage anymore. I also have a small permanent policy, which can pay final expenses. Lisa Green, assigning editor for life insuranceHow to choose between term and whole life insuranceTerm life is sufficient for most families, but whole life and other forms of permanent coverage can be useful in certain situations.Choose term life if you:Only want coverage for a specific period of time. A term life policy can replace your income if you die while you still have major financial obligations, such as raising children or paying off your mortgage.Want the most affordable coverage. Term life insurance is the least expensive option, especially if you\u2019re young and healthy.Think you might want permanent life insurance but can\u2019t afford it right now. You may be able to convert your term life policy to permanent coverage at a later date. The deadline for conversion varies by policy, and not all policies offer conversion.\u00a0Don\u2019t want to use life insurance to accumulate a cash value. Buying a cheaper term life policy lets you save what you would have paid for a whole life policy, and perhaps invest the money elsewhere.Choose whole life if you:Can comfortably afford the higher premiums. Whole life insurance is a lifelong commitment, so you want to make sure you can afford it. If you miss your premium payments, your policy could lapse.Want coverage that essentially lasts your lifetime. The death benefit from whole life policies typically pays out whenever you die. If you name life insurance beneficiaries on your policy, the payout will go directly to them and not through your estate.Have a lifelong dependent like a child with disabilities. Life insurance can fund a trust to provide care for your child after you\u2019re gone. Consult with an attorney and financial advisor before setting up a trust.Want life insurance that builds guaranteed cash value. The cash value of whole life policies grows at a guaranteed rate set by the insurer.\u00bb MORE: Is whole life a good investment?Still not sure whether you need life insurance?
