As long as you keep up with your premium payments and your policy is active when you die, your named beneficiaries can claim a payout from your life insurer. 5 min to readExplore Progressive's editorial standards for Answers articles to find out why you can trust the insurance information you find here.AnswersLife insurance informationWhat is life insurance?Get quoteHow does life insurance work?\nLife insurance works by allowing your beneficiaries to claim a financial payout (often equal to your coverage amount) after your death. If you pass away while the policy is active, your beneficiaries can file a claim for their portion of the payout, also called a death benefit. The payout can be used however your beneficiaries choose \u2014 to cover funeral costs, mortgage payments, education expenses, or anything else.\nSome life insurance policies have additional features. For example, certain life insurance policies have cash value that grows over time, potentially reducing your premium or increasing your death benefit.Pro tip:You can add features to your policy by purchasing life insurance riders. For example, a guaranteed insurability rider lets you add more coverage to your policy in the future without having to go through a medical exam (which would likely raise your rate).Do I need life insurance?\nLife insurance isn't required, but many people decide to buy a policy when they get married, have kids, or take out big loan like a mortgage. To determine if you need life insurance, consider this: If you passed away unexpectedly, would your loved ones struggle financially? If so, consider getting a policy to protect your loved ones.\nAccording to LIMRA's 2022 Insurance Barometer Study, 44% of Americans say their families would feel financial hardship within six months of a wage earner passing away. Life insurance is designed to protect your loved ones from this type of hardship.\nCommon reasons for getting life insurance include covering future college expenses, supporting a partner who relies on your income, or leaving an inheritance for your loved ones. If you're older than 50, a final expense policy (also known as burial insurance) can be an affordable way to make sure your funeral and final expenses are covered. Find out how burial insurance works, and calculate your funeral costs so you can estimate your coverage needs.\nLearn more about when to get life insurance.\nHow much is life insurance?\nA 10-year term life insurance policy from eFinancial costs $24\u201331 per month for a healthy adult who's 20\u201340 years old.* Term life insurance is more affordable than permanent life insurance, and female customers generally get a lower rate than male customers of the same age and health status. Getting life insurance in your 20s or 30s will generally get you a lower premium than if you wait until you're older. \nWhile age and sex are the two major factors that affect the cost of life insurance, other factors like health, weight, tobacco use, and lifestyle can also affect your rate. For instance, if you have a job or hobby that's considered risky, you may pay more to offset the risk of insuring you.\nLearn about how weight affects your life insurance rate and the basics of smoking and life insurance.According to LIMRA's Facts About Life 2021, more than half of Americans overestimate the cost of life insurance by 3 times.

So if you pass away while your policy is active, your beneficiaries can use the payout to cover whatever they choose \u2014 medical bills, funeral costs, education, loans, day-to-day costs, and even savings.\nIf you have a policy, conduct regular life insurance reviews to make sure your beneficiaries are up to date and know how to claim life insurance coverage if you pass.\nFrequently asked life insurance questions\nCan I get life insurance with a pre-existing condition?\nYou're not automatically disqualified from getting life insurance if you have a pre-existing condition. Depending on the condition, it may affect the policy type, rate, and coverage amount an insurer offers you.\nIt's important to be honest and transparent in your life insurance application and during your life insurance medical exam \u2014 failing to disclose requested information can be considered life insurance fraud.\nWhat's the difference between the types of life insurance policies?\nLife insurance policies can be categorized into three main groups, based on how they work:Term life insurance is the most affordable option and only lasts for a set number of years (typically between 10 and 30, though there's also a highly affordable one-year term policy). Your beneficiaries only receive a payout if you pass away during the policy's term.Permanent life insurance lasts your entire lifetime and pays out no matter when you pass away, if you keep paying your premium. Two common types of permanent life insurance are whole life and universal life.Final expense life insurance, also called burial insurance, is technically a type of whole life insurance. However, it's more affordable and accessible for customers over 50. It has a smaller death benefit than standard whole life policies because it's designed to only cover end-of-life expenses, such as funeral and burial costs and medical bills.Learn more about the types of life insurance and the difference between term and whole life insurance.

Here, we'll answer the most common questions about life insurance so you're confident in deciding what's best for you.Get my priceWhat is life insurance?Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and policyholder. In exchange for a premium, the life insurance company agrees to pay a sum of money to one or more named beneficiaries upon the death of the policyholder. The purpose of life insurance is to help provide financial security to your loved ones upon your death. However, some life policies also offer living benefits. This means they can pay a part of the policy's death benefit while you're still alive. These policies can be a financial resource you can use if you're diagnosed with a covered illness that's considered chronic, critical, or terminal. \nWhat types of life insurance are there?Life insurance policies fall into 2 categories: term and permanent.Term life insuranceA term life insurance policy gives you coverage for a set number of years. You can select the term period you want, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If you die during the coverage period and have a covered claim, your policy will pay benefits to your named beneficiaries. If you live past the selected period of time, the policy will simply expire.\nPermanent life insuranceUnlike term life insurance that expires after a set number of years, a permanent life insurance policy doesn't expire and will cover you for your whole life. Permanent life insurance policies remain active until you die, unless you stop paying your premiums or surrender the policy.The 3 most common types of permanent life insurance policies are whole, universal, and variable.\nWhole life insuranceUnlike term life, whole life insurance doesn't have an expiration date. In addition, a portion of the premiums you pay into your whole life policy builds cash value over time.Some insurance companies offer small whole life policies, often referred to as burial insurance. These policies generally come with a death benefit that typically ranges from $5,000 to $25,000 and are often purchased by people who want to leave their beneficiaries with just enough money to cover their final expenses, such as funeral and burial costs.\nUniversal life insuranceLike whole life, a universal life insurance policy provides a lifetime of coverage and can build cash value over time. However, this type of policy also gives flexibility when it comes to making payments. For example, if you have enough cash value in your policy, you can use that money to skip a premium payment.\nVariable life insuranceVariable life is another type of permanent life insurance that can build cash value. However, variable life differs from universal and whole life in that it has the potential to increase the value of certain subaccounts within the policy for even greater growth potential over time. \nWhat type of policy should I choose \u2013 whole or term life insurance?Whether you should pick term or whole life insurance depends on things like your needs and budget.Term life insurance is often a more affordable for people who need coverage but have a limited budget. For people willing to pay more and want a lifetime of coverage and access to cash value, a permanent policy may be a better option.Before buying a term or permanent life insurance policy, it's important to considerHow much coverage you needYour budget and how much you can pay each monthWhat types of policy riders, if any, are available and the costsThe coverage and cost differences between policy types (quote comparisons)\nWhat does a life insurance policy cost?The cost of a life insurance policy depends on things likeThe type of policy Your age and healthThe amount of coverage you wantYour occupationUnfortunately, many people think life insurance is too expensive. The truth is, more than half of Americans overestimate the cost of life insurance by as much as 3 times!1This misperception can put families needlessly at risk of financial hardship. Today, the cost of an average term life insurance for a healthy 30-year-old is estimated to be around $160 per year \u2013 just $13 a month.1While there are a lot of variables when it comes to how much you'll pay for life insurance (policy type, benefit amount, your occupation, etc.), a policy is likely to be a lot less expensive the younger and healthier you are at the time you buy it.\nHow do I choose a beneficiary?The purpose of a life insurance policy is to provide financial support to an individual, organization, or entity after you die. As the policyholder and named insured, you can name any person, organization, or entity to be the beneficiary of your life insurance policy.However, the beneficiaries you pick must have what the insurance industry calls \u201can insurable interest\u201d in your life. Simply put, the beneficiary list on your policy must have more to lose than gain upon your deathCommon choices for life insurance beneficiaries includeSpouseChild(ren)Domestic partnerFriendEstate or trustCharitable organizationLegal entity, such as a family business\nHow and when do my beneficiaries get paid?Upon your death, your beneficiaries must file a claim with the life insurance company as benefits aren't automatically paid. In most states, a death claim can be filed online, by contacting the agent, or by calling the life insurance company directly.While the rules can differ by state, to receive any benefits, the insurance company will typically require beneficiaries toVerify the death of the policyholder (in most states, this means providing the life insurance company with a certified copy of the deceased death certificate and their social security number).Verify their identity and relationship to the insured. This can include a copy of the beneficiary's driver's license and/or Social Security number.Provide a copy of the life insurance policy or the policy number. There's no time limit for a beneficiary to file a death claim. However, the sooner a claim is filed, and the insurance company receives the required paperwork, the sooner the benefit can be paid.In general, once a valid claim has been filed, payment is typically made within 30 days, although it can sometimes take up to 60 days.2 If there are multiple beneficiaries, each person must file their own claim.Beneficiaries can typically receive their money by check or electronic transfer. In addition, they can also select how much money to receive. For example, they can receive all the money as a lump sum, by way of an installment or annuity plan, or a retained asset account (where the insurance company acts as the bank and allows a beneficiary to write checks against the balance).3\nOverwhelmed?
