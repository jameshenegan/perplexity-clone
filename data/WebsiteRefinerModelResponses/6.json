It considers factors such as your mortgage, other debts, income replacement, funeral costs, and education for your children. If you have a family that depends on your financial support or if you have a mortgage, term life insurance could be a sensible option. Permanent life insurance provides coverage for your entire life and may have investment features, but it typically costs more than term insurance.",
