                    "content": "The differences between term life insurance and whole life insurance generally come down to four factors: cost, coverage length, cash value, and complexity.\n\n**Cost**:\n- Term life insurance: Lower premiums\n- Whole life insurance: Higher premiums\n\n**Coverage length**:\n- Term life insurance: You choose, typically between 10 and 30 years\n- Whole life insurance: Lasts your entire life if you pay your premiums\n\n**Cash value**:\n- Term life insurance: No cash value\n- Whole life insurance: Yes, grows in value over time at a fixed rate\n\n**Complexity**:\n- Term life insurance: Coverage is straightforward, with fixed premiums and death benefit\n- Whole life insurance: Coverage is more complex, as the death benefit amount can change if you have an outstanding loan against your policy's cash value\n\nIn summary, term life insurance is simpler and more affordable but has an expiration date and doesn't include a cash value feature. Whole life insurance is more expensive and complex, but it provides lifelong coverage and builds cash value over time. Choosing between the two will depend on your specific needs and financial situation.",
