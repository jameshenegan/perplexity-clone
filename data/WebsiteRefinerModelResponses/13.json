                    "content": "When term life insurance expires, it typically ends without any action needed from the policyholder. The insurance carrier sends a notice, premiums stop, and there is no longer a death benefit. If the policy included a return-of-premium feature, the policyholder would receive a check for the premiums paid during the term.\n\nSome term policies offer the option to renew on a year-by-year basis after the initial term expires, which maintains the original coverage amount but is usually more expensive each year due to age-related risk increases. This option is beneficial for those who develop health issues that make obtaining new insurance challenging.\n\nAdditionally, many term policies include a conversion rider that allows the policyholder to convert their term policy into a permanent policy without needing to go through underwriting again. This is a strategic choice for those who develop a health condition or become uninsurable but still need life insurance after their term policy ends.\n\nIf you need further coverage after the term policy expires, you should evaluate other options well in advance of the termination date, as conversion riders typically cannot be added once the policy is in force. Options include renewing the term policy, purchasing a new term policy, or purchasing a permanent life insurance policy.",
