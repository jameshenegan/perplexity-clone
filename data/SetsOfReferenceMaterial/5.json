                "information": "Life insurance is a financial product that provides coverage to policyholders in exchange for regular payments known as premiums. It is designed to protect families and provide financial security by offering a death benefit to beneficiaries upon the insured's passing. Various types of life insurance policies, such as permanent and term life insurance, cater to different needs and preferences. Permanent life insurance options, including whole life and adjustable premium policies, offer lifelong coverage with various payment structures. In contrast, term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years, and is typically more cost-effective for those seeking temporary protection. Life insurance aims to ensure peace of mind for families by safeguarding their financial future."
