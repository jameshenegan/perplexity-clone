                "information": "When choosing your coverage amount for life insurance, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Income Replacement**: If you are the primary income earner, assess how much of your income needs to be replaced. Common guidance suggests covering a multiple of your income based on your age: \n   - 30X your income between ages 18 and 40\n   - 20X income for ages 41-50\n   - 15X income for ages 51-60\n   - 10X income for ages 61-65\n\n2. **Dependents**: The more dependents you have and the younger they are, the more coverage you may need to provide financial support in your absence.\n\n3. **Debts and Financial Obligations**: Account for all your debts (excluding the mortgage), including car payments, credit cards, and student loans, as well as final expenses (around $7,000).\n\n4. **Mortgage**: Consider your mortgage payoff amount and any other real estate-related debts.\n\n5. **Education Costs**: Plan for anticipated college costs for each child, estimating between $100,000 and $150,000 per child.\n\n6. **Final Expenses**: Include funds to cover funeral costs and other final expenses.\n\n7. **Current Savings**: Adjust your total needed coverage by subtracting any current savings or existing life insurance you already have.\n\n8. **Financial Advice**: Consult a financial professional to tailor your coverage amount to your unique situation, as your personal assets, obligations, and goals may also affect your insurance needs.\n\nUltimately, choose an amount that gives you the most reassurance that your family will be financially secure even if you are not there to provide for them."
