In exchange for paying a premium, the life insurance company agrees to provide a specified sum of money to one or more named beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. The primary purpose of life insurance is to offer financial security to your loved ones after your passing, helping them manage potential financial burdens such as debts, living expenses, and any medical or funeral costs. There are two main types of life insurance: Term Life Insurance, which offers coverage for a set period, and Permanent Life Insurance, which includes coverage for the policyholder's lifetime and can include a cash value component. Life insurance helps protect your beneficiaries from financial distress and delivers financial peace of mind."
