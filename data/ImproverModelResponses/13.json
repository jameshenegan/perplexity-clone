                "content": "If you outlive your term life insurance policy, the policy typically expires without any action needed from you. You will no longer have life insurance coverage, and there will be no death benefit paid out. If your policy had a return-of-premium feature, you might receive a refund of the premiums you paid over the term.\n\nAfter the policy expires, you have a few options if you still need coverage. Some term policies allow you to renew them on a year-by-year basis, but usually at a higher cost due to increased age-related risks. Alternatively, if your policy includes a conversion rider, you may convert your term policy into a permanent one without undergoing the underwriting process again, though there may be time restrictions for this option.\n\nIf you determine that you still need life insurance coverage, you can evaluate whether to convert your existing policy, renew the term policy, buy a new term policy, or consider a permanent life insurance policy. Permanent policies tend to be more expensive than term policies. Factors such as whether you have dependents, outstanding debts, business obligations, and your overall financial stability should be considered when deciding on the best option for your situation.",
