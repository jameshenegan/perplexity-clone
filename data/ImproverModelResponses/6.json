It helps cover debts like a mortgage, replaces your income, covers funeral expenses, and can even fund college for your children. Life insurance provides a financial safety net, ensuring that your family maintains their living standard and is not burdened by economic hardships. The payout your beneficiaries receive is generally tax-free, providing full benefits without additional financial strain. Life insurance gives peace of mind by securing a financial future for your loved ones, acting as a crucial part of financial planning.",
