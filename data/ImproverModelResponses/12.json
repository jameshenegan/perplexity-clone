                "content": "Term life insurance and whole life insurance differ mainly in terms of cost, coverage length, cash value, and complexity. Term life insurance typically has lower premiums and provides coverage for a set period, usually between 10 to 30 years, and does not build cash value. On the other hand, whole life insurance has higher premiums, offers lifelong coverage as long as premiums are paid, and includes a cash value savings component that accumulates over time. Term life insurance is straightforward with fixed premiums and death benefits, while whole life insurance is more complex since the death benefit can vary depending on any loans taken against its cash value.",
