Within these categories, there are specific programs such as the Veterans Affairs Life Insurance (VALife), which is tailored for service-connected veterans, providing guaranteed acceptance whole life coverage[2][3].\n\nSome life insurance policies also include living benefits that allow the policyholder to access a portion of the death benefit if diagnosed with a chronic, critical, or terminal illness[1]. Regulatory standards govern life insurance to ensure transparency and protect consumers, involving detailed illustrations of policy performance and requirements[4].",

It operates as a contract between an insurance company and the policyholder, whereby the insurer agrees to pay a designated sum of money to the beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death, in exchange for periodic premium payments [1][5]. \n\nLife insurance serves the primary purpose of ensuring financial security for the policyholder's loved ones, helping to cover expenses such as funerals, debts, or other financial needs that might arise after the policyholder's passing [1][5]. Additionally, some life insurance policies also offer living benefits. This provision allows a policyholder diagnosed with a covered chronic, critical, or terminal illness to access a portion of the death benefit while still alive, providing additional support during their lifetime [1].\n\nThere are various types of life insurance products available to meet different needs and preferences. Permanent life insurance, which includes whole life and adjustable premium policies, offers lifelong coverage and can build cash value over time. Term life insurance provides protection for a specific period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years, and is often more affordable for temporary coverage needs [5]. \n\nFurthermore, life insurance is designed to guarantee peace of mind, ensuring the financial well-being of families should the unforeseen happen, and regulatory standards are in place to ensure transparency and consumer protection in policy illustrations and agreements [4][5].",
