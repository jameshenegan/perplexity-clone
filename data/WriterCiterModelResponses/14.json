Life insurance can be categorized into different types, including term life insurance and whole life insurance, each serving various financial needs and offering specific coverage options [1][4].\n\nMoreover, some life insurance policies offer living benefits, which allow a portion of the policy's death benefit to be accessed while the policyholder is still alive, under certain conditions [1]. Illustrations of life insurance policies are essential tools that demonstrate how such policies are expected to perform over time, detailing benefits, required premiums, and related expenses to help consumers understand the product better [4]. \n\nSpecific programs, such as those offered by Veterans Affairs, cater to particular groups, such as service-connected Veterans, offering options like VA Life Insurance, which provides up to $40,000 in whole life insurance coverage with guaranteed acceptance for eligible individuals [2][3].",

In exchange for the payment of a premium, the life insurance company commits to paying a specified sum of money to one or more designated beneficiaries when the policyholder passes away [1][5]. The primary goal of life insurance is to provide financial security for the policyholder's loved ones, assisting them in managing economic obligations like debts, living expenses, and costs related to medical care or funerals [5]. There are two main types of life insurance: Term Life Insurance, which provides coverage for a predetermined duration, and Permanent Life Insurance, which offers lifelong coverage and may include a cash value component [5].\n\nAdditionally, life insurance policies can sometimes offer living benefits, where a portion of the death benefit can be accessed during the policyholder's lifetime under specific conditions [1]. Various programs cater to specific groups, such as the Veterans Affairs Life Insurance (VALife) for veterans, which ensures guaranteed acceptance for eligible individuals and coverage of up to $40,000 [2][3]. Life insurance illustrations are used as tools to project how a policy is expected to perform, including details on benefits, premiums, and related expenses [4]. These aspects are regulated to ensure consumer protection and education about life insurance products [4].",
