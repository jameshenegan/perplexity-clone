It does not build cash value, and the coverage ends if the policyholder outlives the term with no benefits paid out after the term expires [1][2][3][4].\n\nWhole life insurance, in contrast, provides lifelong coverage as long as premiums are paid. While more costly, it accumulates cash value over time at a guaranteed rate, which can be borrowed against. Additionally, premiums for whole life insurance remain level throughout the policyholder's life, and the death benefit is assured [1][2][3][4].\n\nChoosing between the two depends on an individual's specific needs and financial objectives. Term life is typically chosen for its affordability and temporary coverage requirements, whereas whole life is preferred for those seeking permanent coverage and cash value growth as part of a long-term financial strategy [1][2][3].",

Term life insurance offers coverage for a specified period, typically between 10 and 30 years, making it more affordable than whole life insurance, which covers the insured for their entire lifetime [1][2][3][4]. While term life insurance does not include a cash value component, whole life insurance accumulates cash value over time, which can be borrowed against or withdrawn [1][2][3][4]. The premiums for term life insurance are generally lower and simpler, although they can increase upon renewal, whereas whole life insurance tends to have higher, but fixed premiums [1][2][3]. Moreover, term life insurance only pays a death benefit if the insured passes away within the policy term, whereas whole life insurance guarantees a death benefit [2][3]. Term life insurance is typically suitable for those seeking low-cost and temporary coverage, while whole life insurance is designed for individuals who want lifelong coverage with the advantage of cash value accumulation for long-term financial planning [1][2][3][4].",
