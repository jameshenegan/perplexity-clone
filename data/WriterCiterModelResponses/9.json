                    "content": "Life insurance is distinct from other types of insurance in several fundamental ways. Firstly, its primary purpose is to provide financial security to beneficiaries after the policyholder's death, ensuring their financial protection. This differs from other insurance types, which usually cover the policyholder for specific incidents or losses, such as property damage or health expenses [5].\n\nFurthermore, life insurance is categorized into term and permanent policies. Term life insurance covers a set period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years, while permanent life insurance offers coverage for the policyholder's entire life, provided premiums are paid. In contrast, other insurance types typically offer coverage for specific incidents or timeframes [5].\n\nUpon the policyholder's death, life insurance provides a death benefit payout to beneficiaries as a lump sum or in other forms, whereas other insurance types like auto or health insurance cover specific losses or damages experienced by the policyholder [5]. Additionally, some life insurance policies offer living benefits, enabling policyholders to access part of the death benefit if diagnosed with a terminal or chronic illness, a feature less common in other insurance policies [5].\n\nMoreover, life insurance serves as a tool for creating a financial legacy, helping dependents maintain their living standards in the absence of the policyholder's income, a focus unique among insurance products [5]. Overall, life insurance is designed to support loved ones financially after a policyholder passes away, unlike other forms of insurance that address immediate costs from incidents involving health, assets, or liabilities [5].",
