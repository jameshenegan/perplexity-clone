This financial payout, known as a death benefit, helps provide financial security to the policyholder\u2019s beneficiaries and can be used for any purposes they choose, such as covering funeral costs or paying off debts like a mortgage [1][2].\n\nThere are two main types of life insurance: term and permanent [2]. **Term Life Insurance** offers coverage for a specified period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If the policyholder dies during the term, the beneficiaries receive the death benefit; if the policyholder outlives the term, the policy expires without payout [2]. **Permanent Life Insurance** provides lifelong coverage as long as premiums are paid and does not expire. It includes various types, such as whole life, which builds cash value over time; universal life, which offers payment flexibility; and variable life, which allows cash value growth through investment options [2].\n\nSome life insurance policies also provide living benefits, allowing the policyholder to withdraw part of the death benefit if diagnosed with a qualifying illness [2]. Beneficiaries must file a claim and provide necessary documentation to receive the payout, which is usually disbursed within 30-60 days in a manner chosen by the beneficiaries, such as a lump sum or installments [2].",

                    "content": "Life insurance operates as a contractual agreement between a life insurance company and a policyholder, wherein the policyholder pays regular premiums in exchange for a financial benefit payable to designated beneficiaries after the policyholder's death[1][2][5]. The primary purpose of life insurance is to provide financial security to the policyholder's loved ones by offering a payout that can be used for funeral expenses, mortgage payments, education costs, and other financial needs[1][5].\n\nThere are two main categories of life insurance: term and permanent. Term life insurance provides coverage for a specified time period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If the policyholder dies during this term, the beneficiaries receive the death benefit. If the policyholder survives the term, the policy expires without any payout[2][5]. \n\nPermanent life insurance, on the other hand, does not expire as long as premiums are continuously paid. It includes types such as whole life, universal life, and variable life insurance, which may accumulate cash value over time[2][5]. This cash value component can be used to reduce premiums or increase the death benefit, and in some cases, policyholders may access or borrow against it[1].\n\nLife insurance policies may also offer living benefits, allowing the policyholder to receive a portion of the death benefit while still alive if diagnosed with a qualifying chronic, critical, or terminal illness[2]. Upon the policyholder's death, beneficiaries must file a claim, providing necessary documentation such as a death certificate to receive the payout, which is typically disbursed within 30 to 60 days. Beneficiaries can choose to receive the benefit as a lump sum, in installments, or through an account managed by the insurance company[2][5].",
