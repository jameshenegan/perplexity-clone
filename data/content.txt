Life Insurance Awareness Month 2024August 28, 2024 Life Insurance



September marks Life Insurance Awareness Month, a time to learn about life insurance's importance in securing families' financial futures. At Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, we view this month as an essential opportunity to educate individuals about their life insurance needs. By fostering awareness, we aim to empower people to feel more comfortable in making informed decisions that can impact their loved one's financial security.Life insurance is more than just a financial product; it embodies a commitment to protect those you care about. Unfortunately, there is a substantial coverage gap among many Americans. Recent studies* indicate that many adults either lack adequate life insurance or have no coverage, potentially exposing families to financial difficulties in the event of an unexpected loss. This gap highlights the necessity of proactively addressing life insurance needs.During this Life Insurance Awareness Month, we encourage individuals to take the time to evaluate their current life insurance policies with the assistance of their local Farm Bureau agents. Engaging in this review process can help clarify the options available and facilitate informed decision-making. By understanding the various coverage possibilities, individuals can better secure peace of mind for themselves and their families.Helping safeguard the financial well-being of loved ones is of utmost importance. We urge everyone to consider their life insurance needs and to engage in discussions with their agents. Taking these steps can help lead to more secure futures and ensure that families are more prepared for any uncertainties that may arise. *LIMRA 2024 Barometer Report

Planning For The Future
Planning for the Future with Life InsuranceNovember 28, 2023 Life Insurance



Life is full of uncertainties, and while we can't predict the future, we can certainly plan for it. One aspect of preparing for the future is having life insurance. Whether you're just starting a family, approaching retirement, or anywhere in between, life insurance can play a pivotal role in safeguarding your loved ones and helping with financial stability in times of need. Let’s explore the importance of planning for the future with life insurance and how it can provide peace of mind for you and your family.Life insurance can help provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event of your untimely passing. Having one or more life insurance policies could help lessen your family’s financial hardships. This protection can help cover various expenses for your family, including:· Mortgage or rent payments· Utility bills· Childcare and education expenses· Day-to-day living costs· Estate Planning and Wealth TransferMany people have outstanding debts when they die, such as mortgages, car loans, or credit card balances. Life insurance can cover these debts, preventing your loved ones from being burdened with repayment. It may ensure that your family can maintain their quality of life.Life insurance can also help replace your lost income and help ensure that your family's standard of living doesn't suffer much. It can provide a safety net that can cover daily expenses, education costs, and long-term financial goals, such as retirement planning.Life insurance can also be a valuable tool in estate planning. It allows you to designate beneficiaries who will receive the proceeds from your policy upon your death.When planning for the future, it's essential to choose the type of life insurance that aligns with your goals and budget. The two primary types of life insurance are:· Term Life Insurance: Provides coverage for a specified term (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years) at a generally more affordable rate.· Whole Life Insurance: Can offer lifelong coverage at level premium amounts. It includes a savings component, allowing the policy to accumulate cash value over time.It’s good to know that life insurance isn't a one-and-done decision. As your life circumstances change—such as getting married, having children, buying a home, or starting a business—it's crucial to review and update your life insurance policy to ensure it continues to meet your needs. https://www.sfbli.com/findanagentSouthern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company offers life insurance in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.

Women And Insurance
Women and InsuranceOctober 06, 2023 



As mothers, daughters, sisters, and partners, women play an integral role in their families lives, providing love, care, and support that form the cornerstone of strong family bonds. In this journey of life, it's essential for women to consider a vital tool that can ensure their families financial well-being – life insurance. Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company aims to shed light on why women need life insurance and how it can safeguard their loved one's future.Many women are active contributors to their family's finances, whether as breadwinners, co-breadwinners, or caregivers who provide invaluable support. In the event of a woman's passing, her income and contributions might leave a significant gap in her family's financial stability. Life insurance can help bridge this gap by providing the necessary funds to cover daily expenses, education, and even mortgage payments, ensuring that her family's quality of life remains intact.For women who play a caregiving role in their family, their absence could lead to emotional and financial challenges. Life insurance offers a way to continue their care, whether for children, aging parents, or others dependent on their support. This can ease the transition and allow the family to maintain their routines and be prepared for the future.Every family has dreams and aspirations, such as providing a good education for their children or purchasing a home. Life insurance may help ensure that these dreams don't remain unfulfilled due to unforeseen circumstances. By planning ahead, women can help secure their family's long-term goals even if they're no longer there to see them through.Life insurance isn't just about planning for the worst – it's about ensuring that the love, care, and support women provide to their families are never compromised, even in their absence. By securing life insurance, women can continue to play a significant role in their families' lives, regardless of what the future holds. At Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, we understand the importance of family and our agents are here to help you navigate this essential aspect of financial planning.

Planning For The Future
Planning for the Future with Life InsuranceNovember 28, 2023 Life Insurance



Life is full of uncertainties, and while we can't predict the future, we can certainly plan for it. One aspect of preparing for the future is having life insurance. Whether you're just starting a family, approaching retirement, or anywhere in between, life insurance can play a pivotal role in safeguarding your loved ones and helping with financial stability in times of need. Let’s explore the importance of planning for the future with life insurance and how it can provide peace of mind for you and your family.Life insurance can help provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event of your untimely passing. Having one or more life insurance policies could help lessen your family’s financial hardships. This protection can help cover various expenses for your family, including:· Mortgage or rent payments· Utility bills· Childcare and education expenses· Day-to-day living costs· Estate Planning and Wealth TransferMany people have outstanding debts when they die, such as mortgages, car loans, or credit card balances. Life insurance can cover these debts, preventing your loved ones from being burdened with repayment. It may ensure that your family can maintain their quality of life.Life insurance can also help replace your lost income and help ensure that your family's standard of living doesn't suffer much. It can provide a safety net that can cover daily expenses, education costs, and long-term financial goals, such as retirement planning.Life insurance can also be a valuable tool in estate planning. It allows you to designate beneficiaries who will receive the proceeds from your policy upon your death.When planning for the future, it's essential to choose the type of life insurance that aligns with your goals and budget. The two primary types of life insurance are:· Term Life Insurance: Provides coverage for a specified term (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years) at a generally more affordable rate.· Whole Life Insurance: Can offer lifelong coverage at level premium amounts. It includes a savings component, allowing the policy to accumulate cash value over time.It’s good to know that life insurance isn't a one-and-done decision. As your life circumstances change—such as getting married, having children, buying a home, or starting a business—it's crucial to review and update your life insurance policy to ensure it continues to meet your needs. https://www.sfbli.com/findanagentSouthern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company offers life insurance in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.

About Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance CompanyIn 1946, Southern Farm Bureau Life was organized through the efforts of Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas’s Farm Bureau Federations.  The company’s vision was to meet the needs of southern farmers and their families, a group they felt was underinsured.  Today, both the company and its members have expanded.  The company now serves ten states across the south.  Southern Farm Bureau Life’s motto is “Helping you is what we do best!”Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance SaysSouthern Farm Bureau offers term and permanent life insurance. Permanent life insurance provides coverage for a policy owner’s entire life. Death benefits are paid when the policyholder dies.  These policies build cash value from premium payments, giving the insured more options than other forms of insurance. Southern Farm Bureau offers a wide variety of options such as whole life, 15 payment life, 20 payment life, 30 payment life, modified premium whole, single premium whole and adjustable premium life insurance.  Although all of these options provide lifelong coverage, they vary in payment plans.  Whole life usually requires a set, annual fee to keep the policy in force. The others (15, 20, 30 payment plans) have specified terms for payment.  Modified premium whole insurance initially starts with lower premiums but increases in later years.  With single premium whole, the insured pays a one-time lump sum as a payment for a lifetime of coverage.  Adjustable premium life gives the flexibility to change payment amounts through the years. Term-life offers cheap coverage for a set amount of years, usually a contracted period of time.  If the insured dies within that time period, the death benefits will be paid to the family.  Southern Farm Bureau Life plans come in 10, 20 and 30 year intervals.  At the end of the time span, the policy expires and must be renewed for coverage to continue.   Contact Southern Bureau  Life Insurance Company at: Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company P.O.
