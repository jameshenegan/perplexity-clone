However, premiums are likely to rise each year based on your current age.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Renew Your Policy**: Many insurers offer the possibility to renew the term on a year-by-year basis, but the premiums generally increase due to the higher risk associated with aging [1][3].\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Convert Your Policy**: Some term policies allow you to convert them into permanent policies, such as whole or universal life insurance, without requiring a new medical exam. This can be advantageous if your health has deteriorated, making it difficult to qualify for new insurance [1][2][3].\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Buy a New Policy**: If you still require life insurance coverage, purchasing a new policy is an option. This typically involves higher premiums and possibly a medical exam, especially if you are older or seek substantial coverage. In some cases, smaller policies might be combined to achieve desired coverage [3][4].\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider a Burial Policy**: As an alternative, you might opt for a smaller, permanent policy such as a burial insurance policy, which is often easier to obtain without a medical exam [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Return-of-Premium Option**: If your term policy includes a return-of-premium rider, you could receive a refund of the premiums paid during the term, though this feature generally raises the policy's cost [1][2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, it's essential to review your financial situation, health status, and insurance needs well in advance of your policy's expiration to determine the best course of action [1][2][3].\n",
      "---\n",
      "If you outlive your term life insurance policy, the policy will typically end without any required actions, and there will be no death benefit or continuation of the coverage [1][5]. However, you have several options to maintain coverage if necessary:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Renew Your Policy**: Many insurers allow you to renew your term policy year-by-year, although at a higher premium due to increased age-related risks [1][3][4][5].\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Convert Your Policy**: If your policy includes a conversion rider, you can convert it to a permanent life insurance plan, such as whole life or universal life. This option usually does not require a new medical exam, making it beneficial if your health has declined [1][2][4][5]. Timing restrictions may apply, so this option should be considered well before the policy term ends [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Buy a New Policy**: Depending on your needs and health status, you might consider purchasing a new term or permanent life insurance policy. Although new policies typically require a medical exam and may have higher premiums due to increased age, they provide coverage tailored to your current situation [2][3][4].\n",
      "\n",
      "If your initial policy had a return-of-premium feature, you may receive back the premiums paid over the term [1][2]. Deciding whether to pursue continued coverage should involve evaluating your financial needs, health status, and life circumstances, such as dependents and debts [5].\n",
