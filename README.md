# Perplexity Experiment

## Purpose of Experiment

The purpose of the experiment is to **evaluate and optimize the visibility of SFBLIC within generative search engine results.**

## Steps to preparing to run the Experiment

- Generate a collection of queries
- Build a corpus of information
- Identify improvement methods to use for experiment

## Comments on Storage

- When building the product out, I will save my responses as JSON files.
- There will be several folders for storage:
  - **InitialGoogleReponses**
  - **UpdatedGoogleResponses**
  - **WebsiteRefinerModelResponses**
  - etc.
- Each folder will have several files: one file per "trial"

## Single Trial of Experiment

- :white_check_mark: Declare a **Trial Number**
- :white_check_mark: Select a **query** to use for the current trial.
  - Example: Where to buy life insurance in Mississippi?
- :white_check_mark: Submit the query to google
- :white_check_mark: Store the response from Google in **InitialGoogleReponses**
- :white_check_mark: Retrieve the stored InitialGoogleReponse. Check to see if SFBLIC is in the top K links. If not, add it. Store the results in **UpdatedGoogleResponses**.
- :white_check_mark: Retrieve the Updated Google Responses. For each of the top K links,
  - Fetch the HTML associated with the link
  - Get the raw text associated with the HTML
  - Store the raw text in RawTextFromHTML
- :white_check_mark: For each element of raw text that was stored,
  - Use the **Website Refiner Model** to filter the raw text to the **refined text**: text that is relevant to the query
  - Store the response from the Website Refiner Model in **WebsiteRefinerModelResponses**.
- :white_check_mark: Use the **Corpus Refiner Model** to filter the corpus to information that may be relevant to the query. Store the response in **CorpusRefinerModelResponses**.
- For each of the M improvement methods,
  - Use the **Improver Model** to either edit or augment the refined text associated with the SFBLIC website, along with the refined text for the other top K links.
  - Store the results from the Improver model in **ImproverModelResponses**.
- Prepare various (M+1) sets of **reference material** that will be sent to the **Writer Citer Model** in the next step.
  - One set will contain the original (unimproved) refined text associated with the SFBLIC website, along with the refined text for the other top K links.
  - Each of the other (M) sets will contain "improved" (i.e., edited or augmented) versions of the refined text associated with the SFBLIC website, along with the refined text for the other top K links
  - Store the results in **SetsOfReferenceMaterial**
- For each of the M+1 sets of reference material,
  - Send a prompt to the **Writer Citer** model. The model is asked to compose a response to the original query, citing the sources provided in the reference material.
  - Store the response from the Writer Citer in **WriterCiterModelResponses**.
- For each resposne from the Writer Citer model,
  - Compute a visibility score for SFBLIC
  - Store the result in **SfblicVisibilityScores**

## Corpus of Information

OLDWICK, N.J., April 24, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has revised the outlook to positive from stable for the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (Long-Term ICR) and affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICR of "aa-" (Superior) of Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company (Southern Farm Bureau Life) (Jackson, MS). The outlook of the FSR is stable.

The Credit Ratings (ratings) reflect Southern Farm Bureau Life’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).

The positive outlook on the Long-Term ICR reflects Southern Farm Bureau Life’s growing individual life line of business, as well as its consistent trend in net income year over year, while remaining within the strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Southern Farm Bureau Life’s operating performance has exhibited consistent growth in top line premium, driven by the company’s diverse network of associated Farm Bureau Federations across 11 states. In addition, operating results are supported by the company’s favorable market position in Farm Bureau communities and its loyal policyholder base, which are reflected in a good persistency trend. Management’s execution of the overall strategy has led to a trend of strong earnings on an operating and net basis.

The company’s business profile remains favorable as Southern Farm Bureau Life continues to utilize effective cross-selling opportunities with affiliates while maintaining an exclusive multi-line agency force. The company’s ERM program continues to be appropriate and includes proper risk management and governance functions. Overall, AM Best expects Southern Farm Bureau Life’s balance sheet strength to remain at the strongest level, driven by its conservative investment strategy, strong cash flows and sustained organic earnings.

Throughout our Company’s history, our commitment
to exceptional service has been the inspiration for our
employees and leadership. The services we provide
are essential to our agents’ ability to sell our products,
which is critical for our Company’s success. Our mission is clear: we are dedicated to delivering superior

and agents. Over the past 75 years, our home office
employees have remained faithful in supporting this
mission. Their guidance and assistance to our agency
force have contributed significantly to our Company’s
reputation as a strong, sound, and secure institution.
In 2023, we celebrated significant milestones together, a testament to the hard work of our agency force

reflect the trust our clients place in our products and
the dedication of our agents to serve with excellence

promote our products and serve our clients directly
align with our mission. Equally vital are the employees
at our home office, who play a key role in our Company’s success. Our core goal is to protect and serve
families, providing them with peace of mind as they
support their loved ones.

In 2023, our Company reached the goal of a new milestone of $200 Billion of Life Insurance In
Force. The chart above showcases the totals of Life Insurance In Force for the past 40 years. As
you can see, it has grown significantly for the last 20 years.

Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company hitting $25 Billion in
Submitted Volume is a significant accomplishment that showcases the
company’s financial stance. This achievement reflects our commitment
to providing excellent service to our agents and customers, which
has been instrumental in achieving this goal of our strategic vision
across our eleven states. Reaching this milestone indicates
our policyholder’s trust and confidence in our brand and
distinguishes our position in the insurance industry. The $25
billion benchmark proves our financial success, allowing us
to maintain the culture and engagement we enjoy today.
We should all be proud to have shown great
initiative, creativity, and teamwork in assisting our
field force in accomplishing this milestone.
Once again, congratulations on being a part
of this amazing achievement!

   │   └── SfblicVisibilityScores/
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── README.md
   └── setup.py
   ```

2. **Initialize Git for version control**:

   - `git init`
   - Add a `.gitignore` file (e.g., exclude `__pycache__`, `.env`, etc.)
   - Commit the initial project structure.

3. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`).
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc.) and update `requirements.txt`.

---

### **Step 2: Define Classes**

1. **`GoogleInteractor`**:

   - Handles querying Google and fetching initial results.
   - Methods:
     - `submit_query(query: str) -> dict`
     - `fetch_html(link: str) -> str`

2. **`StorageManager`**:

   - Manages saving and retrieving data as JSON files.
   - Methods:
     - `save_to_folder(folder_name: str, data: dict, filename: str)`
     - `load_from_folder(folder_name: str, filename: str) -> dict`

3. **`WebsiteRefinerModel`**:

   - Filters raw HTML to extract relevant text.
   - Methods:
     - `refine(raw_text: str, query: str) -> str`

4. **`CorpusRefinerModel`**:

   - Filters a corpus for query relevance.
   - Methods:
     - `refine(corpus: list[str], query: str) -> list[str]`

5. **`ImproverModel`**:

   - Edits or augments refined text for improvement.
   - Methods:
     - `improve(text: str) -> str`

6. **`WriterCiterModel`**:
   - Generates query responses using reference material.
   - Methods:
     - `generate_response(query: str, references: list[str]) -> dict`

---

### **Step 3: Create the Workflow**

- Implement the workflow in `main.py`:
  - Instantiate required classes.
  - Follow the described sequence:
    1. Submit query and store initial results.
    2. Check for SFBLIC in top K links and update results.
    3. Fetch raw HTML for top K links.
    4. Process raw text with `WebsiteRefinerModel`.
    5. Refine the corpus with `CorpusRefinerModel`.
    6. Improve text using `ImproverModel`.
    7. Create reference materials and generate Writer Citer responses.
    8. Compute and store visibility scores.

---

### **Step 4: Add Unit Tests**

- Use `unittest` or `pytest` to create unit tests for each class in the `tests/` directory.
- Example tests:
  1. **`test_google_interactor.py`**:
     - Mock Google API calls to test query submission and HTML fetching.
  2. **`test_storage_manager.py`**:
     - Validate saving and loading JSON files.
  3. **`test_website_refiner_model.py`**:
     - Test that input raw text is properly refined based on the query.
  4. **`test_corpus_refiner_model.py`**:
     - Validate corpus filtering for query relevance.
  5. **`test_improver_model.py`**:
     - Check that input text is correctly edited or augmented.
  6. **`test_writer_citer_model.py`**:
     - Mock the response generation process and verify expected outputs.

---

### **Step 5: Integrate Git Workflows**

1. **Commit changes regularly**:
   - After each major addition (e.g., implementing a class or workflow step).
   - Write clear commit messages (e.g., "Implement WebsiteRefinerModel class").
2. **Use branches for features**:

   - Create feature branches (e.g., `feature/google-interactor`) and merge after completion.

3. **Tag versions**:
   - Tag milestones (e.g., `v0.1` for the first working prototype).

---

### **Step 6: Add Documentation**

1. **Update README.md**:
   - Describe the purpose, installation, and usage.
2. **Docstrings**:
   - Add docstrings for all methods and classes.
3. **Generate a usage guide**:
   - Include a sample workflow in the README.

---

### **Step 7: Future Enhancements**

- Add logging for debugging and audit trails.
- Integrate continuous integration (CI) with GitHub Actions for automated testing.
- Optimize performance for large-scale trials.

This plan should provide a solid foundation for writing the program with an organized, scalable, and maintainable approach.

```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def create_google_service(api_key, search_engine_id):
    """Create a Google Custom Search API service."""
    return build("customsearch", "v1", developerKey=api_key), search_engine_id


from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def parse_html(html_content):
    """Parse HTML content and extract raw text."""
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    return soup.get_text()


from dotenv import dotenv_values

google_api_key = config['GOOGLE_API_KEY']
search_engine_id = config['SEARCH_ENGINE_ID']

google_service, search_id = create_google_service(google_api_key, search_engine_id)


# Step 3: Refined query gets submitted to Google.
search_results = search_google(google_service, search_id, query)
```
