# Experiment involving a Perplexity Clone

The purpose of this repository is to record some ideas related to an experiment involving [Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735).

Large companies such as [Microsoft](https://blogs.bing.com/search/July-2024/generativesearch) and [Google](https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/) have been in the process of rolling out generative engines since at least 2023, while newer companies such as [Perplexity AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity_AI) have been speciliazing in the development of generative engines.

The purpose of the experiment is to see how different sets of **reference material** influence the **visibility metrics** of websites that get sited by a generative engine. In particular, we focus on improving the visibility metrics related to a particular website we have selected.

## Notebooks

The notebooks are a good place to get started if you want to see what we're doing with our experiment.

- [Perplexity Clone](notebooks/perplexity-clone.ipynb): This notebook walks through the basics of what a generative engine does.
- [Single Trial of Experiment](notebooks/run-through-single-trial-of-experiment.ipynb): This notebook walks though a single trial of an experiment.

## Next Steps

- Add additional improvement methods
- Improve the way that results are stored, accessed, and presented
